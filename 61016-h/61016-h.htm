<p>Having pocketed his fare the
freckled rustic took himself and his antediluvian
cab back to the village limbo from
which they had briefly emerged. Loughlin checked
his luggage into the care of the porter, an angular
man with one eye who was apparently the only other
living being in this remote minute station, and sat
down in the platform shade. July noon had a stark
eye-tiring brightness, and a silence so very deep—when
that porter ceased his intolerable clatter—that
Loughlin could hear footsteps crunching in the road
half a mile away. The train was late. There were no
other passengers. Nothing to look at except his
trunks, two shiny rails in the grim track, red hollyhocks
against white palings on the opposite bank.</p>

<p>The holiday in this quiet neighbourhood had
delighted him, but its crowning experience had been
too brief. On the last day but one the loveliest
woman he had ever known had emerged almost as
briefly as that cabman. Some men are constantly
meeting that woman. Not so the Honourable
Gerald Loughlin, but no man turns his back tranquilly
on destiny even if it is but two days old and
already some half-dozen miles away. The visit had
come to its end, Loughlin had come to his station, the
cab had gone back to its lair, but on reflection he
could find no other reasons for going away and denying
himself the delight of this proffered experience.
Time was his own, as much as he could buy of it, and
he had an income that enabled him to buy a good deal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

<p>Moody and hesitant he began to fill his pipe when
the one-eyed porter again approached him.</p>

<p>“Take a pipe of that?” said Loughlin, offering
him the pouch.</p>

<p>“Thanky, sir, but I can’t smoke a pipe; a cigarette
I take now and again, thanky, sir, not often, just
to keep me from cussing and damming. My wife
buys me a packet sometimes, she says I don’t swear
so much then, but I don’t know, I has to knock ’em
off soon’s they make me feel bad, and then, dam it all,
I be worsen ever....”</p>

<p>“Look here,” said the other, interrupting him,
“I’m not going by this train after all. Something
I have forgotten. Now look after my bags and I’ll
come along later, this afternoon.” He turned and
left the station as hurriedly as if his business was
really of the high importance the porter immediately
conceived it to be.</p>

<p>The Honourable Gerald, though handsome and
honest, was not a fool. A fool is one who becomes
distracted between the claims of instinct and common
sense; the larger foolishness is the peculiar doom of
imaginative people, artists and their kind, while the
smaller foolishness is the mark of all those who have
nothing but their foolishness to endorse them.
Loughlin responded to this impulse unhesitatingly
but without distraction, calmly and directly as became
a well-bred bachelor in the early thirties. He might
have written to the young beauty with the queer
name, Orianda Crabbe, but that course teemed with
absurdities and difficulties for he was modest, his
romantic imagination weak, and he had only met her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
at old Lady Tillington’s a couple of days before. Of
this mere girl, just twenty-three or twenty-four, he
knew nothing save that they had been immediately
and vividly charming to each other. That was no
excuse for presenting himself again to the old invalid
of Tillington Park, it would be impossible for him
to do so, but there had been one vague moment of
their recalled intercourse, a glimmering intimation,
which just now seemed to offer a remote possibility
of achievement, and so he walked on in the direction
of the park.</p>

<p>Tillington was some miles off and the heat was
oppressive. At the end of an hour’s stroll he stepped
into “The Three Pigeons” at Denbury and drank
a deep drink. It was quiet and deliciously cool in the
taproom there, yes, as silent as that little station had
been. Empty the world seemed to-day, quite empty;
he had not passed a human creature. Happily
bemused he took another draught. Eighteen small
panes of glass in that long window and perhaps as
many flies buzzing in the room. He could hear and
see a breeze saluting the bright walled ivy outside and
the bushes by a stream. This drowsiness was heaven,
it made so clear his recollection of Orianda. It was
impossible to particularize but she was in her way,
her rather uncultured way, just perfection. He had
engaged her upon several themes, music, fishing
(Loughlin loved fishing), golf, tennis, and books;
none of these had particularly stirred her but she had
brains, quite an original turn of mind. There had
been neither time nor opportunity to discover anything
about her, but there she was, staying there, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
was the one thing certain, apparently indefinitely, for
she described the park in a witty detailed way even to
a certain favourite glade which she always visited in
the afternoons. When she had told him that, he
could swear she was not finessing; no, no, it was a
most engaging simplicity, a frankness that was
positively marmoreal.</p>

<p>He would certainly write to her; yes, and he began
to think of fine phrases to put in a letter, but could
there be anything finer, now, just at this moment,
than to be sitting with her in this empty inn. It was
not a fair place, though it was clean, but how she
would brighten it, yes! there were two long settles
and two short ones, two tiny tables and eight spittoons
(he <i>had</i> to count them), and somehow he felt her
image flitting adorably into this setting, defeating
with its native glory all the scrupulous beer-smelling
impoverishment. And then, after a while, he would
take her, and they would lie in the grass under a deep-bosomed
tree and speak of love. How beautiful she
would be. But she was not there, and so he left the
inn and crossed the road to a church, pleasant and
tiny and tidy, whitewalled and clean-ceilinged. A
sparrow chirped in the porch, flies hummed in the
nave, a puppy was barking in the vicarage garden.
How trivial, how absurdly solemn, everything seemed.
The thud of the great pendulum in the tower had the
sound of a dead man beating on a bar of spiritless
iron. He was tired of the vapid tidiness of these
altars with their insignificant tapestries, candlesticks
of gilded wood, the bunches of pale flowers oppressed
by the rich glow from the windows. He longed for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
an altar that should be an inspiring symbol of belief,
a place of green and solemn walls with a dark velvet
shrine sweeping aloft to the peaked roof unhindered
by tarnishing lustre and tedious linen. Holiness was
always something richly dim. There was no more
holiness here than in the tough hassocks and rush-bottomed
chairs; not here, surely, the apple of Eden
flourished. And yet, turning to the lectern, he noted
the large prayer book open at the office of marriage.
He idly read over the words of the ceremony, filling
in at the gaps the names of Gerald Wilmot Loughlin
and Orianda Crabbe.</p>

<p>What a fool! He closed the book with a slam and
left the church. Absurd! You <i>couldn’t</i> fall in love
with a person as sharply as all that, could you? But
why not? Unless fancy was charged with the lightning
of gods it was nothing at all.</p>

<p>Tramping away still in the direction of Tillington
Park he came in the afternoon to that glade under
a screen of trees spoken of by the girl. It was
green and shady, full of scattering birds. He flung
himself down in the grass under a deep-bosomed
tree. She had spoken delightfully of this delightful
spot.</p>

<p>When she came, for come she did, the confrontation
left him very unsteady as he sprang to his feet.
(Confound that potation at “The Three Pigeons”!
Enormously hungry, too!) But he was amazed,
entranced, she was so happy to see him again. They
sat down together, but he was still bewildered and
his confusion left him all at sixes and sevens. Fortunately
her own rivulet of casual chatter carried them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
on until he suddenly asked: “Are you related
to the Crabbes of Cotterton—I fancy I know
them?”</p>

<p>“No, I think not, no, I am from the south country,
near the sea, nobody at all, my father keeps an inn.”</p>

<p>“An inn! How extraordinary! How very ...
very ...”</p>

<p>“Extraordinary?” Nodding her head in the
direction of the hidden mansion she added: “I am
her companion.”</p>

<p>“Lady Tillington’s?”</p>

<p>She assented coolly, was silent, while Loughlin
ransacked his brains for some delicate reference that
would clear him over this ... this ... cataract. But
he felt stupid—that confounded potation at “The
Three Pigeons”! Why, that was where he had
thought of her so admirably, too. He asked if she
cared for the position, was it pleasant, and so on.
Heavens, what an astonishing creature for a domestic,
quite positively lovely, a compendium of delightful
qualities, this girl, so frank, so simple!</p>

<p>“Yes, I like it, but home is better. I should love
to go back to my home, to father, but I can’t, I’m
still afraid—I ran away from home three years ago,
to go with my mother. I’m like my mother, she ran
away from home too.”</p>

<p>Orianda picked up the open parasol which she had
dropped, closed it in a thoughtful manner, and laid
its crimson folds beside her. There was no other
note of colour in her white attire; she was without a
hat. Her fair hair had a quenching tinge upon it that
made it less bright than gold, but more rare. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
cheeks had the colour of homely flowers, the lily and
the pink. Her teeth were as even as the peas in a
newly opened pod, as clear as milk.</p>

<p>“Tell me about all that. May I hear it?”</p>

<p>“I have not seen him or heard from him since, but
I love him very much now.”</p>

<p>“Your father?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but he is stern, a simple man, and he is so
just. We live at a tiny old inn at the end of a village
near the hills. ‘The Black Dog.’ It is thatched
and has tiny rooms. It’s painted all over with pink,
pink whitewash.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I know.”</p>

<p>“There’s a porch, under a sycamore tree, where
people sit, and an old rusty chain hanging on a hook
just outside the door.”</p>

<p>“What’s that for?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>
<p>“I don’t know what it is for, horses, perhaps, but
it is always there, I always see that rusty chain. And
on the opposite side of the road there are three lime
trees and behind them is the yard where my father
works. He makes hurdles and ladders. He is the
best hurdle maker in three counties, he has won many
prizes at the shows. It is splendid to see him working
at the willow wood, soft and white. The yard is full
of poles and palings, spars and fagots, and long
shavings of the thin bark like seaweed. It smells so
nice. In the spring the chaffinches and wrens are
singing about him all day long; the wren is lovely, but
in the summer of course it’s the whitethroats come
chippering, and yellow-hammers.”</p>

<p>“Ah, blackbirds, thrushes, nightingales!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it’s the little birds seem to love my
father’s yard.”</p>

<p>“Well then, but why did you, why did you run
away?”</p>

<p>“My mother was much younger, and different
from father; she was handsome and proud too, and
in all sorts of ways superior to him. They got to hate
each other; they were so quiet about it, but I could
see. Their only common interest was me, they both
loved me very much. Three years ago she ran away
from him. Quite suddenly, you know; there was
nothing at all leading up to such a thing. But I could
not understand my father, not then, he took it all so
calmly. He did not mention even her name to me
for a long time, and I feared to intrude; you see, I
did not understand, I was only twenty. When I did
ask about her he told me not to bother him, forbade
me to write to her. I didn’t know where she was, but
he knew, and at last I found out too.”</p>

<p>“And you defied him, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“No, I deceived him. He gave me money for
some purpose—to pay a debt—and I stole it. I left
him a letter and ran away to my mother. I loved her.”</p>

<p>“O well, that was only to be expected,” said
Loughlin. “It was all right, quite right.”</p>

<p>“She was living with another man. I didn’t know.
I was a fool.”</p>

<p>“Good lord! That was a shock for you,” Loughlin
said. “What did you do?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>
<p>“No, I was not shocked, she was so happy. I
lived with them for a year....”</p>

<p>“Extraordinary!”</p>

<p>“And then she died.”</p>

<p>“Your mother died!”</p>

<p>“Yes, so you see I could not stop with my ...
I could not stay where I was, and I couldn’t go back
to my father.”</p>

<p>“I see, no, but you want to go back to your father
now.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid. I love him, but I’m afraid. I don’t
blame my mother, I feel she was right, quite right—it
was such happiness. And yet I feel, too, that
father was deeply wronged. I can’t understand that,
it sounds foolish. I should so love to go home again.
This other kind of life doesn’t seem to eclipse me—things
have been extraordinary kind—I don’t feel
out of my setting, but still it doesn’t satisfy, it is
polite and soft, like silk, perhaps it isn’t barbarous
enough, and I want to live, somehow—well, I have
not found what I wanted to find.”</p>

<p>“What did you want to find?”</p>

<p>“I shan’t know until I have found it. I do want
to go home now, but I am full of strange feelings
about it. I feel as if I was bearing the mark of something
that can’t be hidden or disguised of what my
mother did, as if I were all a burning recollection for
him that he couldn’t fail to see. He is good, a just
man. He ... he is the best hurdle maker in three
counties.”</p>

<p>While listening to this daughter of a man who
made ladders the Honourable Gerald had been
swiftly thinking of an intriguing phrase that leaped
into his mind. Social plesiomorphism, that was it!
Caste was humbug, no doubt, but even if it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
conscious humbug it was there, really there, like the
patterned frost upon a window pane, beautiful though
a little incoherent, and conditioned only by the size
and number of your windows. (Eighteen windows
in that pub!) But what did it amount to, after all?
It was stuck upon your clear polished outline for
every eye to see, but within was something surprising
as the sight of a badger in church—until you got
used to the indubitable relation of such badgers to
such churches. Fine turpitudes!</p>

<p>“My dear girl,” he burst out, “your mother and
you were right, absolutely. I am sure life is enhanced
not by amassing conventions, but by destroying them.
And your feeling for your father is right, too, rightest
of all. Tell me ... let me ... may I take you back
to him?”</p>

<p>The girl’s eyes dwelt upon his with some intensity.</p>

<p>“Your courage is kind,” she said, “but he doesn’t
know you, nor you him.” And to that she added,
“You don’t even know me.”</p>

<p>“I have known you for ten thousand years. Come
home to him with me, we will go back together. Yes,
you can explain. Tell him”—the Honourable
Gerald had got the bit between his teeth now—“tell
him I’m your sweetheart, will you—will
you?”</p>

<p>“Ten thousand ...! Yes, I know; but it’s
strange to think you have only seen me just once
before!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>
<p>“Does that matter? Everything grows from that
one small moment into a world of ... well of ...
boundless admiration.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want,” said Orianda, reopening her
crimson parasol, “to grow into a world of any kind.”</p>

<p>“No, of course you don’t. But I mean the
emotion is irresistible, ‘the desire of the moth for the
star,’ that sort of thing, you know, and I immolate
myself, the happy victim of your attractions.”</p>

<p>“All that has been said before.” Orianda
adjusted her parasol as a screen for her raillery.</p>

<p>“I swear,” said he, “I have not said it before,
never to a living soul.”</p>

<p>Fountains of amusement beamed in her brilliant
eyes. She was exquisite; he was no longer in doubt
about the colour of her eyes—though he could not
describe them. And the precise shade of her hair was—well,
it was extraordinarily beautiful.</p>

<p>“I mean—it’s been said to me!”</p>

<p>“O damnation! Of course it’s been said to you.
Ah, and isn’t that my complete justification? But
you agree, do you not? Tell me if it’s possible.
Say you agree, and let me take you back to your
father.”</p>

<p>“I think I would like you to,” the jolly girl said,
slowly.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>On an August morning a few weeks later they
travelled down together to see her father. In
the interim Orianda had resigned her appointment,
and several times Gerald had met her secretly
in the purlieus of Tillington Park. The girl’s cool
casual nature fascinated him not less than her
appearance. Admiration certainly outdistanced his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
happiness, although that also increased; but the bliss
had its shadow, for the outcome of their friendship
seemed mysteriously to depend on the outcome of the
proposed return to her father’s home, devotion to
that project forming the first principle, as it were, of
their intercourse. Orianda had not dangled before
him the prospect of any serener relationship; she took
his caresses as naturally and undemonstratively as a
pet bird takes a piece of sugar. But he had begun to
be aware of a certain force behind all her charming
naivete; the beauty that exhaled the freshness, the
apparent fragility, of a drop of dew had none the less
a savour of tyranny which he vowed should never,
least of all by him, be pressed to vulgar exercise.</p>

<p>When the train reached its destination Orianda
confided calmly that she had preferred not to write to
her father. Really she did not know for certain
whether he was alive or even living on at the old home
she so loved. And there was a journey of three miles
or more which Orianda proposed to walk. So they
walked.</p>

<p>The road lay across an expanse of marshy country
and approached the wooded uplands of her home
only by numerous eccentric divagations made
necessary by culverts that drained the marsh. The
day was bright; the sky, so vast an arch over this
flat land, was a very oven for heat; there were cracks
in the earth, the grass was like stubble. At the mid
journey they crossed a river by its wooden bridge,
upon which a boy sat fishing with stick and string.
Near the water was a long white hut with a flag; a
few tethered boats floated upon the stream. Gerald<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
gave a shilling to a travelling woman who carried a
burden on her back and shuffled slowly upon the
harsh road sighing, looking neither to right nor left;
she did not look into the sky, her gaze was fastened
upon her dolorous feet, one two, one two, one two;
her shift, if she had such a garment, must have clung
to her old body like a shrimping net.</p>

<p>In an hour they had reached the uplands and soon,
at the top of a sylvan slope where there was shade and
cooling air, Gerald saw a sign hung upon a sycamore
tree, <i>The Black Dog by Nathaniel Crabbe</i>. The inn
was small, pleasant with pink wash and brown paint,
and faced across the road a large yard encircled by
hedges, trees, and a gate. The travellers stood
peeping into the enclosure which was stocked with
new ladders, hurdles, and poles of various sizes.
Amid them stood a tall burly man at a block,
trimming with an axe the butt of a willow rod. He
was about fifty, clad in rough country clothes, a white
shirt, and a soft straw hat. He had mild simple
features coloured, like his arms and neck, almost to
the hue of a bay horse.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” called the girl. The man with the axe
looked round at her unrecognizingly. Orianda
hurried through the gateway. “Father!” she cried.</p>

<p>“I did not know. I was not rightly sure of ye,”
said the man, dropping the axe, “such a lady you’ve
grown.”</p>

<p>As he kissed his daughter his heavy discoloured
hands rested on her shoulders, her gloved ones lay
against his breast. Orianda took out her purse.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>
<p>“Here is the money I stole, father.”</p>

<p>She dropped some coins one by one into his palm.
He counted them over, and saying simply “Thank
you, my dear,” put them into his pocket.</p>

<p>“I’m dashed!”—thought Loughlin, who had
followed the girl—“it’s exactly how <i>she</i> would take
it; no explanation, no apology. They do not know
what reproach means. Have they no code at all?”</p>

<p>She went on chatting with her father, and seemed
to have forgotten her companion.</p>

<p>“You mean you want to come back!” exclaimed
her father eagerly, “come back here? That would
be grand, that would. But look, tell me what I am
to do. I’ve—you see—this is how it is—”</p>

<p>He spat upon the ground, picked up his axe,
rested one foot upon the axe-block and one arm upon
his knee. Orianda sat down upon a pile of the logs.</p>

<p>“This is how it is ... be you married?”</p>

<p>“Come and sit here, Gerald,” called the girl.
As he came forward Orianda rose and said: “This
is my very dear friend, father, Gerald Loughlin.
He has been so kind. It is he who has given me the
courage to come back. I wanted to for so long. O,
a long time, father, a long time. And yet Gerald had
to drag me here in the end.”</p>

<p>“What was you afraid of, my girl?” asked the
big man.</p>

<p>“Myself.”</p>

<p>The two visitors sat upon the logs. “Shall I tell
you about mother?” asked the girl.</p>

<p>Crabbe hesitated; looked at the ground.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, you might,” he said.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>
<p>“She died, did you know?”</p>

<p>The man looked up at the trees with their myriads
of unmoving leaves; each leaf seemed to be listening.</p>

<p>“She died?” he said softly. “No, I did not
know she died.”</p>

<p>“Two years ago,” continued the girl, warily, as if
probing his mood.</p>

<p>“Two years!” He repeated it without emotion.
“No, I did not know she died. ’Tis a bad job.” He
was quite still, his mind seemed to be turning over
his own secret memories, but what he bent forward
and suddenly said was: “Don’t say anything about
it in there.” He nodded towards the inn.</p>

<p>“No?” Orianda opened her crimson parasol.</p>

<p>“You see,” he went on, again resting one foot on
the axe-block and addressing himself more particularly
to Gerald: “I’ve ... this is how it is. When I
was left alone I could not get along here, not by
myself. That’s for certain. There’s the house and
the bar and the yard—I’d to get help, a young woman
from Brighton. I met her at Brighton.” He rubbed
the blade of the axe reflectively across his palm—“And
she manages house for me now, you see.”</p>

<p>He let the axe fall again and stood upright. “Her
name’s Lizzie.”</p>

<p>“O, quite so, you could do no other,” Gerald
exclaimed cheerfully, turning to the girl. But
Orianda said softly: “What a family we are! He
means he is living with her. And so you don’t want
your undutiful daughter after all, father?” Her
gaiety was a little tremulous.</p>

<p>“No, no!” he retorted quickly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span> “you must come
back, you must come back, if so be you can. There’s
nothing I’d like better, nothing on this mortal earth.
My God, if something don’t soon happen I don’t
know what <i>will</i> happen.” Once more he stooped
for the axe. “That’s right, Orianda, yes, yes, but
you’ve no call to mention to her”—he glared uneasily
at the inn doorway—“that ... that about your
mother.”</p>

<p>Orianda stared up at him though he would not
meet her gaze.</p>

<p>“You mean she doesn’t know?” she asked, “you
mean she would want you to marry her if she did
know?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s about how it is with us.”</p>

<p>Loughlin was amazed at the girl’s divination. It
seemed miraculous, what a subtle mind she had,
extraordinary! And how casually she took the old
rascal’s—well, what could you call it?—effrontery,
shame, misdemeanour, helplessness. But was not
her mother like it too? He had grasped nothing at
all of the situation yet, save that Nathaniel Crabbe
appeared to be netted in the toils of this housekeeper,
this Lizzie from Brighton. Dear Orianda was
“dished” now, poor girl. She could not conceivably
return to such a menage.</p>

<p>Orianda was saying: “Then I may stay, father,
mayn’t I, for good with you?”</p>

<p>Her father’s eyes left no doubt of his pleasure.</p>

<p>“Can we give Gerald a bedroom for a few days?
Or do we ask Lizzie?”</p>

<p>“Ah, better ask her,” said the shameless man.
“You want to make a stay here, sir?”</p>

<p>“If it won’t incommode you,” replied Loughlin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span></p>

<p>“O, make no doubt about that, to be sure no, I
make no doubt about that.”</p>

<p>“Have you still got my old bedroom?” asked
Orianda, for the amount of dubiety in his air was in
prodigious antagonism to his expressed confidence.</p>

<p>“Why yes, it may happen,” he replied slowly.</p>

<p>“Then Gerald can have the spare room. It’s all
wainscot and painted dark blue. It’s a shrimp of a
room, but there’s a preserved albatross in a glass case
as big as a van.”</p>

<p>“I make no doubt about that,” chimed in her
father, straightening himself and scratching his chin
uneasily, “you must talk to Lizzie.”</p>

<p>“Splendid!” said Gerald to Orianda, “I’ve
never seen an albatross.”</p>

<p>“We’ll ask Lizzie,” said she, “at once.”</p>

<p>Loughlin was experiencing not a little inward
distress at this turn in the affair, but it was he who had
brought Orianda to her home, and he would have to
go through with the horrid business.</p>

<p>“Is she difficult, father?”</p>

<p>“No, she’s not difficult, not difficult, so to say,
you must make allowance.”</p>

<p>The girl was implacable. Her directness almost
froze the blood of the Hon. Loughlin.</p>

<p>“Are you fond of her. How long has she been
here?”</p>

<p>“O, a goodish while, yes, let me see—no, she’s
not difficult, if that’s what you mean—three years,
perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Well, but that’s long enough!”</p>

<p>(Long enough for what—wondered Loughlin?)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span></p>

<p>“Yes, it is longish.”</p>

<p>“If you really want to get rid of her you could
tell her ...”</p>

<p>“Tell her what?”</p>

<p>“You know what to tell her!”</p>

<p>But her father looked bewildered and professed his
ignorance.</p>

<p>“Take me in to her,” said Orianda, and they all
walked across to “The Black Dog.” There was
no one within; father and daughter went into the
garden while Gerald stayed behind in a small parlour.
Through the window that looked upon a grass plot
he could see a woman sitting in a deck chair under a
tree. Her face was turned away so that he saw only
a curve of pink cheek and a thin mound of fair hair
tossed and untidy. Lizzie’s large red fingers were
slipping a sprig of watercress into a mouth that was
hidden round the corner of the curve. With her
other hand she was caressing a large brown hen that
sat on her lap. Her black skirt wrapped her limbs
tightly, a round hip and a thigh being rigidly outlined,
while the blouse of figured cotton also seemed
strained upon her buxom breast, for it was torn and
split in places. She had strong white arms and holes
in her stockings. When she turned to confront
the others it was easy to see that she was a foolish,
untidy, but still a rather pleasant woman of about
thirty.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Lizzie?” cried Orianda,
offering a cordial hand. The hen fluttered away as,
smiling a little wanly, the woman rose.</p>

<p>“Who is it, ’Thaniel?” she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

<p>Loughlin heard no more, for some men came noisily
into the bar and Crabbe hurried back to serve them.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>In the afternoon Orianda drove Gerald in the gig
back to the station to fetch the baggage.</p>

<p>“Well, what success, Orianda?” he asked as
they jogged along.</p>

<p>“It would be perfect but for Lizzie—that <i>was</i>
rather a blow. But I should have foreseen her—Lizzies
are inevitable. And she <i>is</i> difficult—she
weeps. But, O I am glad to be home again. Gerald,
I feel I shall not leave it, ever.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Orianda,” he protested, “leave it for me.
I’ll give your nostalgia a little time to fade. I think
it was a man named Pater said: ‘All life is a wandering
to find home.’ You don’t want to omit the
wandering?”</p>

<p>“Not if I have found my home again?”</p>

<p>“A home with Lizzie!”</p>

<p>“No, not with Lizzie.” She flicked the horse
with the whip. “I shall be too much for Lizzie;
Lizzie will resume her wandering. She’s as stupid
as a wax widow in a show. Nathaniel is tired of
Lizzie, and Lizzie of Nathaniel. The two wretches!
But I wish she did not weep.”</p>

<p>Gerald had not observed any signs of tearfulness in
Lizzie at the midday dinner; on the contrary, she
seemed rather a jolly creature, not that she had spoken
much beyond “Yes, ’Thaniel, No, ’Thaniel,” or
Gerald, or Orianda, as the case had been. Her use
of his Christian name, which had swept him at once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
into the bosom of the family, shocked him rather
pleasantly. But he did not know what had taken
place between the two women; perhaps Lizzie had
already perceived and tacitly accepted her displacement.</p>

<p>He was wakened next morning by unusual sounds,
chatter of magpies in the front trees, and the ching of
hammers on a bulk of iron at the smithy. Below his
window a brown terrier stood on its barrel barking
at a goose. Such common simple things had power
to please him, and for a few days everything at “The
Black Dog” seemed planned on this scale of novel
enjoyment. The old inn itself, the log yard, harvesting,
the chatter of the evening topers, even the village
Sunday delighted him with its parade of Phyllis and
Corydon, though it is true Phyllis wore a pink frock,
stockings of faint blue, and walked like a man, while
Corydon had a bowler hat and walked like a bear.
He helped ’Thaniel with axe, hammer, and plane, but
best of all was to serve mugs of beer nightly in the
bar and to drop the coins into the drawer of money.
The rest of the time he spent with Orianda whom he
wooed happily enough, though without establishing
any marked progress. They roamed in fields and in
copses, lounged in lanes, looking at things and idling
deliciously, at last returning home to be fed by Lizzie,
whose case somehow hung in the air, faintly deflecting
the perfect stream of felicity.</p>

<p>In their favourite glade a rivulet was joined by a
number of springs bubbling from a pool of sand and
rock. Below it the enlarged stream was dammed into
a small lake once used for turning a mill, but now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
since the mill was dismantled, covered with arrow
heads and lily leaves, surrounded by inclining trees,
bushes of rich green growth, terraces of willow herb,
whose fairy-like pink steeples Orianda called “codlins
and cream,” and catmint with knobs of agreeable
odour. A giant hornbeam tree had fallen and lay half
buried in the lake. This, and the black poplars whose
vacillating leaves underscored the solemn clamour
of the outfall, gave to it the very serenity of desolation.</p>

<p>Here they caught sight of the two woodpeckers
bathing in the springs, a cock and his hen, who had
flown away yaffling, leaving a pretty mottled feather
tinged with green floating there. It was endless
pleasure to watch each spring bubble upwards from
a pouch of sand that spread smoke-like in the water,
turning each cone into a midget Vesuvius. A wasp
crawled laboriously along a flat rock lying in the
pool. It moved weakly, as if, marooned like a
mariner upon some unknown isle, it could find no
way of escape; only, this isle was no bigger than a
dish in an ocean as small as a cartwheel. The wasp
seemed to have forgotten that it had wings, it creepingly
examined every inch of the rock until it came
to a patch of dried dung. Proceeding still as wearily
it paused upon a dead leaf until a breeze blew leaf
and insect into the water. The wasp was overwhelmed
by the rush from the bubbles, but at last
it emerged, clutching the woodpecker’s floating
feather and dragged itself into safety as a swimmer
heaves himself into a boat. In a moment it preened
its wings, flew back to the rock, and played at Crusoe
again. Orianda picked the feather from the pool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>

<p>“What a fool that wasp is,” declared Gerald, “I
wonder what it is doing?”</p>

<p>Orianda, placing the feather in his hat, told him
it was probably wandering to find home.</p>

<p>One day, brightest of all days, they went to picnic
in the marshes, a strange place to choose, all rank
with the musty smell of cattle, and populous with
grasshoppers that burred below you and millions,
quadrillions of flies that buzzed above. But Orianda
loved it. The vast area of coarse pasture harboured
not a single farmhouse, only a shed here and there
marking a particular field, for a thousand shallow
brooks flowed like veins from all directions to the
arterial river moving through its silent leagues.
Small frills of willow curving on the river brink, and
elsewhere a temple of lofty elms, offered the only
refuge from sun or storm. Store cattle roamed
unchecked from field to field, and in the shade of
gaunt rascally bushes sheep were nestling. Green
reeds and willow herb followed the watercourses
with endless efflorescence, beautiful indeed.</p>

<p>In the late afternoon they had come to a spot where
they could see their village three or four miles away,
but between them lay the inexorable barrier of the
river without a bridge. There was a bridge miles
away to the right, they had crossed it earlier in the
day; and there was another bridge on the left, but
that also was miles distant.</p>

<p>“Now what are we to do?” asked Orianda. She
wore a white muslin frock, a country frock, and a
large straw hat with poppies, a country hat. They
approached a column of trees. In the soft smooth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
wind the foliage of the willows was tossed into delicate
greys. Orianda said they looked like cockshy heads
on spindly necks. She would like to shy at them,
but she was tired. “I know what we <i>could</i> do.”
Orianda glanced around the landscape, trees, and
bushes; the river was narrow, though deep, not more
than forty feet across, and had high banks.</p>

<p>“You can swim, Gerald?”</p>

<p>Yes, Gerald could swim rather well.</p>

<p>“Then let’s swim it, Gerald, and carry our own
clothes over.”</p>

<p>“Can you swim, Orianda?”</p>

<p>Yes, Orianda could swim rather well.</p>

<p>“All right then,” he said. “I’ll go down here
a little way.”</p>

<p>“O, don’t go far, I don’t want you to go far away,
Gerald,” and she added softly, “my dear.”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t go far,” he said, and sat down
behind a bush a hundred yards away. Here he
undressed, flung his shoes one after the other across
the river, and swimming on his back carried his
clothes over in two journeys. As he sat drying in the
sunlight he heard a shout from Orianda. He peeped
out and saw her sporting in the stream quite close
below him. She swam with a graceful overarm stroke
that tossed a spray of drops behind her and launched
her body as easily as a fish’s. Her hair was bound in a
handkerchief. She waved a hand to him. “You’ve
done it! Bravo! What courage! Wait for me.
Lovely.” She turned away like an eel, and at every
two or three strokes she spat into the air a gay little
fountain of water. How extraordinary she was.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
Gerald wished he had not hurried. By and by he
slipped into the water again and swam upstream.
He could not see her.</p>

<p>“Have you finished?” he cried.</p>

<p>“I have finished, yes.” Her voice was close above
his head. She was lying in the grass, her face
propped between her palms, smiling down at him.
He could see bare arms and shoulders.</p>

<p>“Got your clothes across?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“All dry?”</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>“How many journeys? I made two.”</p>

<p>“Two,” said Orianda briefly.</p>

<p>“You’re all right then.” He wafted a kiss, swam
back, and dressed slowly. Then as she did not appear
he wandered along to her humming a discreet and
very audible hum as he went. When he came upon
her she still lay upon the grass most scantily clothed.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he said hastily, and full of
surprise and modesty walked away. The unembarrassed
girl called after him: “Drying my hair.”</p>

<p>“All right”—he did not turn round—“no
hurry.”</p>

<p>But what sensations assailed him. They aroused
in his decent gentlemanly mind not exactly a tumult,
but a flux of emotions, impressions, and qualms;
doubtful emotions, incredible impressions, and torturing
qualms. That alluring picture of Orianda,
her errant father, the abandoned Lizzie! Had the
water perhaps heated his mind though it had cooled
his body? He felt he would have to urge her, drag<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
her if need be, from this “Black Dog.” The setting
was fair enough and she was fair, but lovely as she
was not even she could escape the brush of its
vulgarity, its plebeian pressure.</p>

<p>And if all this has, or seems to have, nothing, or
little enough to do with the drying of Orianda’s hair,
it is because the Honourable Gerald was accustomed
to walk from grossness with an averted mind.</p>

<p>“Orianda,” said he, when she rejoined him,
“when are you going to give it up. You cannot stay
here ... with Lizzie ... can you?”</p>

<p>“Why not?” she asked, sharply tossing back her
hair. “I stayed with my mother, you know.”</p>

<p>“That was different from this. I don’t know how,
but it must have been.”</p>

<p>She took his arm. “Yes, it was. Lizzie I hate,
and poor stupid father loves her as much as he loves
his axe or his handsaw. I hate her meekness, too.
She has taken the heart out of everything. I must
get her away.”</p>

<p>“I see your need, Orianda, but what can you do?”</p>

<p>“I shall lie to her, lie like a libertine. And I shall
tell her that my mother is coming home at once. No
Lizzie could face that.”</p>

<p>He was silent. Poor Lizzie did not know that
there was now no Mrs. Crabbe.</p>

<p>“You don’t like my trick, do you?” Orianda
shook his arm caressingly.</p>

<p>“It hasn’t any particular grandeur about it, you
know.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>
<p>“Pooh! You shouldn’t waste grandeur on clearing
up a mess. This is a very dirty Eden.”</p>

<p>“No, all’s fair, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“But it isn’t war, you dear, if that’s what you
mean. I’m only doing for them what they are
naturally loth to do for themselves.” She pronounced
the word “loth” as if it rimed with moth.</p>

<p>“Lizzie,” he said, “I’m sure about Lizzie. I’ll
swear there is still some fondness in her funny little
heart.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t love, though; she’s just sentimental in her
puffy kind of way. My dear Honourable, you don’t
know what love is.” He hated her to use his title,
for there was then always a breath of scorn in her
tone. Just at odd times she seemed to be—not
vulgar, that was unthinkable—she seemed to display
a contempt for good breeding. He asked with a
stiff smile “What <i>is</i> love?”</p>

<p>“For me,” said Orianda, fumbling for a definition,
“for me it is a compound of anticipation and gratitude.
When either of these two ingredients is
absent love is dead.”</p>

<p>Gerald shook his head, laughing. “It sounds like
a malignant bolus that I shouldn’t like to take. I feel
that love is just self-sacrifice. Apart from the taste
of the thing or the price of the thing, why and for
what this anticipation, this gratitude?</p>

<p>“For the moment of passion, of course. Honour
thy moments of passion and keep them holy. But O,
Gerald Loughlin,” she added mockingly, “this you
cannot understand, for you are not a lover; you are
not, no, you are not even a good swimmer.” Her
mockery was adorable, but baffling.</p>

<p>“I do not understand you,” he said. Now why in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
the whole world of images should she refer to his
swimming? He <i>was</i> a good swimmer. He was
silent for a long time and then again he began to speak
of marriage, urging her to give up her project and
leave Lizzie in her simple peace.</p>

<p>Then, not for the first time, she burst into a strange
perverse intensity that may have been love but might
have been rage, that was toned like scorn and yet
must have been a jest.</p>

<p>“Lovely Gerald, you must never marry, Gerald,
you are too good for marriage. All the best women
are already married, yes, they are—to all the worst
men.” There was an infinite slow caress in her tone
but she went on rapidly. “So I shall never marry
you, how should I marry a kind man, a good man?
I am a barbarian, and want a barbarian lover, to crush
and scarify me, but you are so tender and I am so
crude. When your soft eyes look on me they look
on a volcano.”</p>

<p>“I have never known anything half as lovely,” he
broke in.</p>

<p>Her sudden emotion, though controlled, was unconcealed
and she turned away from him.</p>

<p>“My love is a gentleman, but with him I should
feel like a wild bee in a canary cage.”</p>

<p>“What are you saying!” cried Gerald, putting
his arms around her. “Orianda!”</p>

<p>“O yes, we do love in a mezzotinted kind of way.
You could do anything with me short of making me
marry you, anything, Gerald.” She repeated it
tenderly. “Anything. But short of marrying me I
could make you do nothing.” She turned from him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
again for a moment or two. Then she took his arm
and as they walked on she shook it and said chaffingly,
“And what a timid swimmer my Gerald is.”</p>

<p>But he was dead silent. That flux of sensations in
his mind had taken another twist, fiery and exquisite.
Like rich clouds they shaped themselves in the sky of
his mind, fancy’s bright towers with shining pinnacles.</p>

<p>Lizzie welcomed them home. Had they enjoyed
themselves—yes, the day had been fine—and so they
had enjoyed themselves—well, well, that was right.
But throughout the evening Orianda hid herself from
him, so he wandered almost distracted about the
village until in a garth he saw some men struggling
with a cow. Ropes were twisted around its horns and
legs. It was flung to the earth. No countryman ever
speaks to an animal without blaspheming it, although
if he be engaged in some solitary work and inspired
to music, he invariably sings a hymn in a voice that
seems to have some vague association with wood pulp.
So they all blasphemed and shouted. One man, with
sore eyes, dressed in a coat of blue fustian and brown
cord trousers, hung to the end of a rope at an angle of
forty-five degrees. His posture suggested that he
was trying to pull the head off the cow. Two other
men had taken turns of other rope around some stout
posts, and one stood by with a handsaw.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked Gerald.</p>

<p>“Its harns be bent, yeu see,” said the man with the
saw, “they be going into its head. ’Twill blind or
madden the beast.”</p>

<p>So they blasphemed the cow, and sawed off its
crumpled horns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

<p>When Gerald went back to the inn Orianda was
still absent. He sat down but he could not rest.
He could never rest now until he had won her
promise. That lovely image in the river spat fountains
of scornful fire at him. “Do not leave me,
Gerald,” she had said. He would never leave her,
he would never leave her. But the men talking in the
inn scattered his flying fiery thoughts. They discoursed
with a vacuity whose very endlessness was
transcendent. Good God! Was there ever a living
person more magnificently inane than old Tottel, the
registrar. He would have inspired a stork to protest.
Of course, a man of his age should not have worn a
cap, a small one especially; Tottel himself was small,
and it made him look rumpled. He was bandy: his
intellect was bandy too.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Mr. Tottel was saying, “it’s very interesting
to see interesting things, no matter if it’s man,
woman, or a object. The most interesting man as
I ever met in my life I met on my honeymoon.
Years ago. He made a lifelong study of railways,
that man, knew ’em from Alpha to ... to ... what
is it?”</p>

<p>“Abednego,” said someone.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span></p>
<p>“Yes, the trunk lines, the fares, the routs, the
junctions of anywheres in England or Scotland or
Ireland or Wales. London, too, the Underground.
I tested him, every station in correct order from
South Kensington to King’s Cross. A strange thing!
Nothing to do with railways in ’imself, it was just his
’obby. Was a Baptist minister, really, but still a most
interesting man.”</p>

<p>Loughlin could stand it no longer, he hurried away
into the garden. He could not find her. Into the
kitchen—she was not there. He sat down excited
and impatient, but he must wait for her, he wanted to
know, to know at once. How divinely she could
swim! What was it he wanted to know? He tried
to read a book there, a ragged dusty volume about the
polar regions. He learned that when a baby whale
is born it weighs at least a ton. How horrible!</p>

<p>He rushed out into the fields full of extravagant
melancholy and stupid distraction. That! All that
was to be her life here! This was your rustic beauty,
idiots and railways, boors who could choke an ox and
chop off its horns—maddening doubts, maddening
doubts—foul-smelling rooms, darkness, indecency.
She held him at arm’s length still, but she was dovelike,
and he was grappled to her soul with hoops of
steel, yes, indeed.</p>

<p>But soon this extravagance was allayed. Dim
loneliness came imperceivably into the fields and he
turned back. The birds piped oddly; some wind
was caressing the higher foliage, turning it all one
way, the way home. Telegraph poles ahead looked
like half-used pencils; the small cross on the steeple
glittered with a sharp and shapely permanence.</p>

<p>When he came to the inn Orianda was gone to
bed.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The next morning an air of uneasy bustle crept
into the house after breakfast, much going in and out
and up and down in restrained perturbation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

<p>Orianda asked him if he could drive the horse and
trap to the station. Yes, he thought he could drive it.</p>

<p>“Lizzie is departing,” she said, “there are her
boxes and things. It is very good of you, Gerald, if
you will be so kind. It is a quiet horse.”</p>

<p>Lizzie, then, had been subdued. She was faintly
affable during the meal, but thereafter she had been
silent; Gerald could not look at her until the last
dreadful moment had come and her things were in
the trap.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, ’Thaniel,” she said to the innkeeper,
and kissed him.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Orianda,” and she kissed Orianda,
and then climbed into the trap beside Gerald, who
said “Click click,” and away went the nag.</p>

<p>Lizzie did not speak during the drive—perhaps
she was in tears. Gerald would have liked to comfort
her, but the nag was unusually spirited and clacked so
freshly along that he did not dare turn to the sorrowing
woman. They trotted down from the uplands
and into the windy road over the marshes. The
church spire in the town ahead seemed to change its
position with every turn of that twisting route. It
would have a background now of high sour-hued
down, now of dark woodland, anon of nothing but
sky and cloud; in a few miles further there would
be the sea. Hereabout there were no trees, few
houses, the world was vast and bright, the sky vast
and blue. What was prettiest of all was a windmill
turning its fans steadily in the draught from the sea.
When they crossed the river its slaty slow-going flow
was broken into blue waves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

<p>At the station Lizzie dismounted without a word
and Gerald hitched the nag to a tree. A porter took
the luggage and labelled it while Gerald and Lizzie
walked about the platform. A calf with a sack over
its loins, tied by the neck to a pillar, was bellowing
deeply; Lizzie let it suck at her finger for a while, but
at last she resumed her walk and talked with her
companion.</p>

<p>“She’s a fine young thing, clever, his daughter;
I’d do anything for her, but for him I’ve nothing to
say. What can I say? What could I do? I gave
up a great deal for that man, Mr. Loughlin—I’d
better not call you Gerald any more now—a great
deal. I knew he’d had trouble with his wicked wife,
and now to take her back after so many years, eh!
It’s beyond me, I know how he hates her. I gave up
everything for him, I gave him what he can’t give
back to me, and he hates her; you know?”</p>

<p>“No, I did not know. I don’t know anything
of this affair.”</p>

<p>“No, of course, you would not know anything of
this affair,” said Lizzie with a sigh. “I don’t want
to see him again. I’m a fool, but I got my pride, and
that’s something to the good, it’s almost satisfactory,
ain’t it?”</p>

<p>As the train was signalled she left him and went
into the booking office. He marched up and down,
her sad case affecting him with sorrow. The poor
wretch, she had given up so much and could yet smile
at her trouble. He himself had never surrendered to
anything in life—that was what life demanded of you—surrender.
For reward it gave you love, this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
swarthy, skin-deep love that exacted remorseless
penalties. What German philosopher was it who
said Woman pays the debt of life not by what she
does, but by what she suffers? The train rushed in.
Gerald busied himself with the luggage, saw that it
was loaded, but did not see its owner. He walked
rapidly along the carriages, but he could not find her.
Well, she was sick of them all, probably hiding from
him. Poor woman. The train moved off, and he
turned away.</p>

<p>But the station yard outside was startlingly empty,
horse and trap were gone. The tree was still there, but
with a man leaning against it, a dirty man with a dirty
pipe and a dirty smell. Had he seen a horse and trap?</p>

<p>“A brown mare?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Trap with yaller wheels?”</p>

<p>“That’s it.”</p>

<p>“O ah, a young ooman druv away in that....”</p>

<p>“A young woman!”</p>

<p>“Ah, two minutes ago.” And he described
Lizzie. “Out yon,” said the dirty man, pointing
with his dirty pipe to the marshes.</p>

<p>Gerald ran until he saw a way off on the level
winding road the trap bowling along at a great pace;
Lizzie was lashing the cob.</p>

<p>“The damned cat!” He puffed large puffs of
exasperation and felt almost sick with rage, but there
was nothing now to be done except walk back to
“The Black Dog,” which he began to do. Rage
gave place to anxiety, fear of some unthinkable
disaster, some tragic horror at the inn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span></p>

<p>“What a clumsy fool! All my fault, my own
stupidity!” He groaned when he crossed the bridge
at the half distance. He halted there: “It’s dreadful,
dreadful!” A tremor in his blood, the shame of his
foolishness, the fear of catastrophe, all urged him to
turn back to the station and hasten away from these
miserable complications.</p>

<p>But he did not do so, for across the marshes at the
foot of the uplands he saw the horse and trap coming
back furiously towards him. Orianda was driving it.</p>

<p>“What has happened?” she cried, jumping from
the trap. “O, what fear I was in, what’s happened?”
She put her arms around him tenderly.</p>

<p>“And I was in great fear,” he said with a laugh
of relief. “What has happened?”</p>

<p>“The horse came home, just trotted up to the door
and stood still. Covered with sweat and foam, you
see. The trap was empty. We couldn’t understand
it, anything, unless you had been flung out and were
bleeding on the road somewhere. I turned the thing
back and came on at once.” She was without a hat;
she had been anxious and touched him fondly. “Tell
me what’s the scare?”</p>

<p>He told her all.</p>

<p>“But Lizzie was not in the trap,” Orianda
declared excitedly. “She has not come back. What
does it mean, what does she want to do? Let us find
her. Jump up, Gerald.”</p>

<p>Away they drove again, but nobody had seen anything
of Lizzie. She had gone, vanished, dissolved,
and in that strong warm air her soul might indeed
have been blown to Paradise. But they did not know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
how or why. Nobody knew. A vague search was
carried on in the afternoon, guarded though fruitless
enquiries were made, and at last it seemed clear,
tolerably clear, that Lizzie had conquered her mad
impulse or intention or whatever it was, and walked
quietly away across the fields to a station in another
direction.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>For a day or two longer time resumed its sweet slow
delightfulness, though its clarity was diminished and
some of its enjoyment dimmed. A village woman
came to assist in the mornings, but Orianda was now
seldom able to leave the inn; she had come home to a
burden, a happy, pleasing burden, that could not often
be laid aside, and therefore a somewhat lonely
Loughlin walked the high and the low of the country
by day and only in the evenings sat in the parlour
with Orianda. Hope too was slipping from his heart
as even the joy was slipping from his days, for the
spirit of vanished Lizzie, defrauded and indicting,
hung in the air of the inn, an implacable obsession, a
triumphant forboding that was proved a prophecy
when some boys fishing in the mill dam hooked dead
Lizzie from the pool under the hornbeam tree.</p>

<p>Then it was that Loughlin’s soul discovered to him
a mass of feelings—fine sympathy, futile sentiment,
a passion for righteousness, morbid regrets—from
which a tragic bias was born. After the dread ordeal
of the inquest, which gave a passive verdict of Found
Drowned, it was not possible for him to stem this
disloyal tendency of his mind. It laid that drowned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
figure accusatively at the feet of his beloved girl, and
no argument or sophistry could disperse the venal
savour that clung to the house of “The Black Dog.”
“To analyse or assess a person’s failings or
deficiencies,” he declared to himself, “is useless, not
because such blemishes are immovable, but because
they affect the mass of beholders in divers ways.
Different minds perceive utterly variant figures in the
same being. To Brown Robinson is a hero, to Jones
a snob, to Smith a fool. Who then is right? You are
lucky if you can put your miserable self in relation at
an angle where your own deficiencies are submerged
or minimized, and wise if you can maintain your
vision of that interesting angle.” But embedded in
Loughlin’s modest intellect there was a stratum of
probity that was rock to these sprays of the casuist;
and although Orianda grew more alluring than ever,
he packed his bag, and on a morning she herself
drove him in the gig to the station.</p>

<p>Upon that miserable departure it was fitting that
rain should fall. The station platform was piled
with bushel baskets and empty oil barrels. It rained
with a quiet remorselessness. Neither spoke a word,
no one spoke, no sound was uttered but the faint
flicking of the raindrops. Her kiss to him was long
and sweet, her good-bye almost voiceless.</p>

<p>“You will write?” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will write.”</p>

<p>But he does not do so. In London he has not
forgotten, but he cannot endure the thought of that
countryside—to be far from the madding crowd is to
be mad indeed. It is only after some trance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
recollection, when his fond experience is all delicately
and renewingly there, that he wavers; but time and
time again he relinquishes or postpones his return.
And sometimes he thinks he really will write a letter
to his friend who lives in the country.</p>

<p>But he does not do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span></p>




<h2 id="Alas_Poor_Bollington"><i>Alas, Poor Bollington!</i></h2>


<p>“I walked out of the hotel, just
as I was, and left her there. I never went back
again. I don’t think I intended anything quite
so final, so dastardly; I had not intended it, I had not
thought of doing so, but that is how it happened. I
lost her, lost my wife purposely. It was heartless, it
was shabby, for she was a nice woman, a charming
woman, a good deal younger than I was, a splendid
woman, in fact she was very beautiful, and yet I ran
away from her. How can you explain that, Turner?”</p>

<p>Poor Bollington looked at Turner, who looked at
his glass of whiskey, and that looked irresistible—he
drank some. Bollington sipped a little from his glass
of milk.</p>

<p>I often found myself regarding Bollington as a
little old man. Most of the club members did so too,
but he was not that at all, he was still on the sunny side
of fifty, but <i>so</i> unassertive, no presence to speak of, no
height, not enough hair to mention—if he had had it
would surely have been yellow. So mild and modest
he cut no figure at all, just a man in glasses that
seemed rather big for him. Turner was different,
though he was just as bald; he had stature and bulk,
his very pince-nez seemed twice the size of
Bollington’s spectacles. They had not met each
other for ten years.</p>

<p>“Well, yes,” Turner said, “but that was a serious
thing to do.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it!” said the other, “and I had no idea
of the enormity of the offence—not at the time.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
She might have been dead, poor girl, and her executors
advertising for me. She had money you know,
her people had been licensed victuallers, quite
wealthy. Scandalous!”</p>

<p>Bollington brooded upon his sin until Turner
sighed: “Ah well, my dear chap.”</p>

<p>“But you have no idea,” protested Bollington,
“how entirely she engrossed me. She was twenty-five
and I was forty when we married. She was
entrancing. She had always lived in a stinking hole
in Balham, and it is amazing how strictly some of
those people keep their children; licensed victuallers,
did I tell you? Well I was forty, and she was
twenty-five; we lived for a year dodging about
from one hotel to another all over the British Isles,
she was a perfect little nomad. Are you married,
Turner?”</p>

<p>No, Turner was not married, he never had been.</p>

<p>“O, but you should be,” cried little Bollington,
“it’s an extraordinary experience, the real business
of the world is marriage, marriage. I was deliriously
happy and she was learning French and Swedish—that’s
where we were going later. She was an
enchanting little thing, fair, with blue eyes; Phoebe
her name was.”</p>

<p>Turner thoughtfully brushed his hand across his
generous baldness, then folded his arms.</p>

<p>“You really should,” repeated Bollington, “you
ought to, really. But I remember we went from
Killarney to Belfast, and there something dreadful
happened. I don’t know, it had been growing on her
I suppose, but she took a dislike to me there, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
strange fancies, thought I was unfaithful to her. You
see she was popular wherever we went, a lively little
woman, in fact she wasn’t merely a woman, she was
a little magnet, men congregated and clung to her
like so many tacks and nails and pins. I didn’t object
at all—on the contrary, ‘Enjoy yourself, Phoebe,’
I said, ‘I don’t expect you always to hang around an
old fogey like me.’ Fogey was the very word I used;
I didn’t mean it, of course, but that was the line I
took, for she was so charming until she began to get so
bad tempered. And believe me, that made her
angry, furious. No, not the fogey, but the idea that I
did not object to her philandering. It was fatal, it
gave colour to her suspicions of me—Turner, I was
as innocent as any lamb—tremendous colour. And
she had such a sharp tongue! If you ventured to
differ from her—and you couldn’t help differing
sometimes—she’d positively bludgeon you, and you
couldn’t help being bludgeoned. And she had a
passion for putting me right, and I always seemed to
be so very wrong, always. She would not be satisfied
until she had proved it, and it was so monstrous
to be made feel that because you were rather different
from other people you were an impertinent fool. Yes,
I seemed at last to gain only the pangs and none of the
prizes of marriage. Now there was a lady we met
in Belfast to whom I paid some attention....”</p>

<p>“O, good lord!” groaned Turner.</p>

<p>“No, but listen,” pleaded Bollington, “it was a
very innocent friendship—nothing was further from
my mind—and she was very much like my wife,
very much, it was noticeable, everybody spoke of it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>—
I mean the resemblance. A Mrs. Macarthy, a
delightful woman, and Phoebe simply loathed her.
I confess that my wife’s innuendoes were so mean and
persistent that at last I hadn’t the strength to deny
them, in fact at times I wished they were true. Love
is idolatry if you like, but it cannot be complete
immolation—there’s no such bird as the phœnix, is
there, Turner?”</p>

<p>“What, what?”</p>

<p>“No such bird as the phœnix.”</p>

<p>“No, there is no such bird, I believe.”</p>

<p>“And sometimes I had to ask myself quite
seriously if I really hadn’t been up to some infidelity!
Nonsense, of course, but I assure you that was the
effect it was having upon me. I had doubts of
myself, frenzied doubts! And it came to a head
between Phoebe and me in our room one day. We
quarrelled, O dear, how we quarrelled! She said
I was sly, two-faced, unfaithful, I was a scoundrel,
and so on. Awfully untrue, all of it. She accused me
of dreadful things with Mrs. Macarthy and she
screamed out: ‘I hope you will treat her better than
you have treated me.’ Now what did she mean by
that, Turner?”</p>

<p>Bollington eyed his friend as if he expected an
oracular answer, but just as Turner was about to
respond, Bollington continued:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span> “Well, I never
found out, I never knew, for what followed was too
terrible. ‘I shall go out,’ I said, ‘it will be better,
I think.’ Just that, nothing more. I put on my hat
and I put my hand on the knob of the door when she
said most violently: ‘Go with your Macarthys, I
never want to see your filthy face again!’ Extraordinary
you know, Turner. Well, I went out, and
I will not deny I was in a rage, terrific. It was raining
but I didn’t care, and I walked about in it. Then I
took shelter in a bookseller’s doorway opposite a shop
that sold tennis rackets and tobacco, and another one
that displayed carnations and peaches on wads of
coloured wool. The rain came so fast that the streets
seemed to empty, and the passers-by were horridly
silent under their umbrellas, and their footsteps
splashed so dully, and I tell you I was very sad,
Turner, there. I debated whether to rush across the
road and buy a lot of carnations and peaches and take
them to Phoebe. But I did not do so, Turner, I
never went back, never.”</p>

<p>“Why, Bollington, you, you were a positive
ruffian, Bollington.”</p>

<p>“O, scandalous,” rejoined the ruffian.</p>

<p>“Well, out with it, what about this Mrs.
Macarthy?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Macarthy? But, Turner, I never saw her
again, never, I ... I forgot her. Yes, I went prowling
on until I found myself at the docks and there it
suddenly became dark; I don’t know, there was no
evening, no twilight, the day stopped for a moment—and
it did not recover. There were hundreds of
bullocks slithering and panting and steaming in the
road, thousands; lamps were hung up in the harbour,
cabs and trollies rattled round the bullocks, the rain
fell dismally and everybody hurried. I went into the
dock and saw them loading the steamer, it was called
s.s. <i>Frolic</i>, and really, Turner, the things they put into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
the belly of that steamer were rather funny: tons and
tons of monstrous big chain, the links as big as soup
plates, and two or three pantechnicon vans. Yes, but
I was anything but frolicsome, I assure you, I was full
of misery and trepidation and the deuce knows what.
I did not know what I wanted to do, or what I was
going to do, but I found myself buying a ticket to go
to Liverpool on that steamer, and, in short, I embarked.
How wretched I was, but how determined.
Everything on board was depressing and dirty, and
when at last we moved off the foam slewed away in
filthy bubbles as if that dirty steamer had been sick
and was running away from it. I got to Liverpool in
the early morn, but I did not stay there, it is such a
clamouring place, all trams and trollies and teashops.
I sat in the station for an hour, the most miserable
man alive, the most miserable ever born. I wanted
some rest, some peace, some repose, but they never
ceased shunting an endless train of goods trucks,
banging and screeching until I almost screamed at
the very porters. Criff was the name on some of the
trucks, I remember, Criff, and everything seemed to
be going criff, criff, criff. I haven’t discovered to
this day what Criff signifies, whether it’s a station or a
company, or a manufacture, but it was Criff, I
remember. Well, I rushed to London and put my
affairs in order. A day or two later I went to Southampton
and boarded another steamer and put to sea,
or rather we were ignominiously lugged out of the
dock by a little rat of a tug that seemed all funnel and
hooter. I was off to America, and there I stopped for
over three years.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span></p>

<p>Turner sighed. A waiter brought him another
glass of spirit.</p>

<p>“I can’t help thinking, Bollington, that it was all
very fiery and touchy. Of course, I don’t know, but
really it was a bit steep, very squeamish of you. What
did your wife say?”</p>

<p>“I never communicated with her, I never heard
from her, I just dropped out. My filthy face, you
know, she did not want to see it again.”</p>

<p>“Oh come, Bollington! And what did Mrs.
Macarthy say?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Macarthy! I never saw or heard of her
again. I told you that.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, you told me. So you slung off to
America.”</p>

<p>“I was intensely miserable there for a long while.
Of course I loved Phoebe enormously, I felt the
separation, I.... O, it is impossible to describe. But
what was worst of all was the meanness of my behaviour,
there was nothing heroic about it, I soon saw
clearly that it was a shabby trick, disgusting, I had
bolted and left her to the mercy of ... well, of whatever
there was. It made such an awful barrier—you’ve
no idea of my compunction—I couldn’t make
overtures—‘Let us forgive and forget.’ I was a mean
rascal, I <i>was</i> filthy. That was the barrier—myself;
I was too bad. I thought I should recover and enjoy
life again, I began to think of Phoebe as a cat, a little
cat. I went everywhere and did everything. But
America is a big country, I couldn’t get into contact,
I was lonely, very lonely, and although two years went
by I longed for Phoebe. Everything I did I wanted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
to do with Phoebe by my side. And then my cousin,
my only relative in the world—he lived in England—he
died. I scarcely ever saw him, but still he was
my kin. And he died. You’ve no comprehension,
Turner, of the truly awful sensation such a bereavement
brings. Not a soul in the world now would
have the remotest interest in my welfare. O, I tell
you, Turner, it was tragic, tragic, when my cousin
died. It made my isolation complete. I was alone,
a man who had made a dreadful mess of life. What
with sorrow and remorse I felt that I should soon
die, not of disease, but disgust.”</p>

<p>“You were a great ninny,” ejaculated his friend.
“Why the devil didn’t you hurry back, claim your
wife, bygones be bygones; why bless my conscience,
what a ninny, what a great ninny!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Turner, it is as you say. But though
conscience is a good servant it is a very bad master, it
overruled me, it shamed me, and I hung on to
America for still another year. I tell you my situation
was unbearable, I was tied to my misery, I was a
tethered dog, a duck without water—even dirty
water. And I hadn’t any faith in myself or in my
case; I knew I was wrong, had always been wrong,
Phoebe had taught me that. I hadn’t any faith, I
wish I had had. Faith can move mountains, so they
say, though I’ve never heard of it actually being
done.”</p>

<p>“No, not in historical times,” declared Turner.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>
<p>“O well, time is nothing, it’s nothing, it comes and
off it goes. Has it ever occurred to you, Bollington,
that in 5,000 years or so there will be nobody in the
world speaking the English language, our very existence
even will be speculated upon, as if we were the
Anthropophagi? O good lord, yes.”</p>

<p>And another whiskey.</p>

<p>“You know, Bollington, you were a perfect fool.
You behaved like one of those half-baked civil service
hounds who lunch in a dairy on a cup of tea and a
cream horn. You wanted some beef, some ginger.
You came back, you must have come back because
there you are now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Turner, I came back after nearly four years.
Everything was different, ah, how strange! I could
not find Phoebe, it is weird how people can disappear.
I made enquiries, but it was like looking for a lost
umbrella, fruitless after so long.”</p>

<p>“Well, but what about Mrs. Macarthy?”</p>

<p>Mr. Bollington said, slowly and with the utmost
precision: “I did not see Mrs. Macarthy again.”</p>

<p>“O, of course, you did not see her again, not ever.”</p>

<p>“Not ever. I feared Phoebe had gone abroad too,
but at last I found her in London....”</p>

<p>“No,” roared Turner, “why the devil couldn’t
you say so and done with it? I’ve been sweating with
sympathy for you. O, I say, Bollington!”</p>

<p>“My dear Turner, listen. Do you know, she was
delighted to see me, she even kissed me, straight off,
and we went out to dine and had the very deuce of a
spread and we were having the very deuce of a good
time. She was lovelier than ever, and I could see all
her old affection for me was returning, she was so ...
well, I can’t tell you, Turner, but she had no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
animosity whatever, no grievance, she would certainly
have taken me back that very night. O dear, dear
... and then! I was anxious to throw myself at her
feet, but you couldn’t do that in a public café, I could
only touch her hands, beautiful, as they lay on the
white linen cloth. I kept asking: ‘Do you forgive
me?’ and she would reply: ‘I have nothing to
forgive, dear, nothing.’ How wonderful that
sounded to my truly penitent soul—I wanted to die.</p>

<p>“‘But you don’t ask me where I’ve been!’ she
cried gaily, ‘or what I’ve been doing, you careless old
Peter. I’ve been to France, and Sweden too!’</p>

<p>“I was delighted to hear that, it was so very
plucky.</p>

<p>“‘When did you go?’ I asked.</p>

<p>“‘When I left you,’ she said.</p>

<p>“‘You mean when I went away?’</p>

<p>“‘Did you go away? O, of course, you must
have. Poor Peter, What a sad time he has had.’</p>

<p>“I was a little bewildered, but I was delighted;
in fact, Turner, I was hopelessly infatuated again, I
wanted to wring out all the dregs of my detestable
villainy and be absolved. All I could begin with was:
‘Were you not very glad to be rid of me?’</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ she said, ‘my great fear at first was that
you would find me again and make it up. I didn’t
want that then, at least, I thought I didn’t.’</p>

<p>“‘That’s exactly what I felt,’ I exclaimed, ‘but
how could I find you?’</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ Phoebe said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span> ‘you might have found out
and followed me. But I promise never to run away
again, Peter dear, never.’</p>

<p>“Turner, my reeling intelligence swerved like a
shot bird.</p>

<p>“‘Do you mean, Phoebe, that you ran away from
<i>me</i>?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, didn’t I?’ she answered.</p>

<p>“‘But I ran away from <i>you</i>,’ I said. ‘I walked
out of the hotel on that dreadful afternoon we
quarrelled so, and I never went back. I went to
America. I was in America nearly four years.’</p>

<p>“‘Do you mean you ran away from me?’ she
cried.</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ I said, ‘didn’t I?’</p>

<p>“‘But that is exactly what I did—I mean, I ran
away from you. <i>I</i> walked out of the hotel directly
you had gone—<i>I</i> never went back, and I’ve been
abroad thinking how tremendously I had served you
out, and wondering what you thought of it all and
where you were.’</p>

<p>“I could only say ‘Good God, Phoebe, I’ve had
the most awful four years of remorse and sorrow, all
vain, mistaken, useless, thrown away.’ And she
said: ’And I’ve had four years—living in a fool’s
paradise after all. How dared you run away, it’s
disgusting!’</p>

<p>“And, Turner, in a moment she was at me again
in her old dreadful way, and the last words I had from
her were: ‘Now I <i>never</i> want to see your face again,
never, this <i>is</i> the end!’</p>

<p>“And that’s how things are now, Turner. It’s
rather sad, isn’t it?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span></p>
<p>“Sad! Why you chump, when was it you saw
her?”</p>

<p>“O, a long time ago, it must be nearly three years
now.”</p>

<p>“Three years! But you’ll see her again!”</p>

<p>“Tfoo! No, no, no, Turner. God bless me, no,
no, no!” said the little old man.</p>

<h2 id="The_Ballet_Girl"><i>The Ballet Girl</i></h2>


<p>On the last night of Hilary
term Simpkins left his father’s shop a quarter
before the closing hour in order to deliver
personally a letter to John Evans-Antrobus, Esq., of
St. Saviour’s College. Simpkins was a clerk to his
father, and the letter he carried was inscribed on its
envelope as “Important,” and a further direction,
“Wait Answer,” was doubly underlined. Acting as
he was told to act by his father, than whom he was
incapable of recognizing any bigger authority either
in this world or, if such a slight, shrinking fellow
could ever project his comprehension so far, in the
next, he passed the porter’s lodge under the archway
of St. Saviour’s, and crossing the first quadrangle,
entered a small hall that bore the names J. Evans-Antrobus
with half a dozen others neatly painted on
the wall. He climbed two flights of wooden stairs,
and knocking over a door whose lintel was marked
“5, Evans-Antrobus,” was invited to “Come in.”
He entered a study, and confronted three hilarious
young men, all clothed immaculately in evening
dress, a costume he himself privily admired much as a
derelict might envy the harp of an angel. The
noisiest young gentleman, the tall one with a monocle,
was his quarry; he handed the letter to him. Mr.
Evans-Antrobus then read the letter, which invited
him to pay instanter a four-year-old debt of some
nine or ten pounds which he had inexplicably but
consistently overlooked. And there was a half-hidden
but unpleasant alternative suggested should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
Mr. Evans-Antrobus fail to comply with this not
unreasonable request. Mr. Evans-Antrobus said
“Damn!” In point of fact he enlarged the scope of
his vocabulary far beyond the limits of that modest
expletive, while his two friends, being invited to read
the missive, also exclaimed in terms that were not at
all subsidiary.</p>

<p>“My compliments to Messrs. Bagshot and
Buffle!” exclaimed the tall young man with the
monocle angrily; “I shall certainly call round and
see them in the morning. Good evening!”</p>

<p>Little Simpkins explained that Bagshot and Buffle
were not in need of compliments, their business being
to sell boots and to receive payment for them. Two
of the jolly young gentlemen proposed to throw him
down the stairs, and were only persuaded not to by
the third jolly young gentleman, who much preferred
to throw him out of the window. Whereupon
Simpkins politely hinted that he would be compelled
to interview the college dean and await developments
in his chambers. Simpkins made it quite clear that,
whatever happened, he was going to wait somewhere
until he got the money. The three jolly young
gentlemen then told little Simpkins exactly what they
thought of him, exactly, omitting no shade of denunciation,
fine or emphatic. They told him where
he ought to be at the very moment, where he would
quickly be unless he took himself off; in short, they
told him a lot of prophetic things which, as is the way
of prophecy, invited a climax of catastrophic horror.</p>

<p>“What is your name? Who the devil are you?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span></p>
<p>“My name is Simpkins.”</p>

<p>Then the three jolly young gentlemen took counsel
together in whispers, and at last Mr. Evans-Antrobus
said: “Well if you insist upon waiting, Mr. Simpkins,
I must get the money for you. I can borrow it,
I suppose, boys, from Fazz, can’t I?”</p>

<p>Again they consulted in whispers, after which two
of the young gents said they ought to be going, and
so they went.</p>

<p>“Wait here for me,” said Mr. Evans-Antrobus,
“I shall not be five minutes.”</p>

<p>But Mr. Simpkins was so firmly opposed to this
course that the other relented. “Damn you! come
along with me, then; I must go and see Fazz.” So
off they went to some rooms higher up the same flight
of stairs, beyond a door that was marked “F. A.
Zealander.” When they entered Fazz sat moping
in front of the fire; he was wrapped as deeply as an
Esquimaux in some plaid travelling rugs girt with
the pink rope of a dressing-gown that lay across his
knees. The fire was good, but the hearth was full of
ashes. The end of the fender was ornamented with
the strange little iron face of a man whose eyes were
shut but whose knobby cheeks fondly glowed.
Fazz’s eyes were not shut, they were covered by dim
glasses, and his cheeks had no more glow than a
sponge.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Fazz. You better to-day?”</p>

<p>“No, dearie, I am not conscious of any improvement.
This influenza’s a thug; I am being deprived
of my vitality as completely as a fried rasher.”</p>

<p>“Oh, by the by,” said his friend, “you don’t
know each other: Mr. Simpkins—Mr. Zealander.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span></p>

<p>The former bowed awkwardly and unexpectedly
shook Mr. Zealander’s hot limp hand. At that
moment a man hurried in, exclaiming: “Mr.
Evans-Antrobus, sir, the Dean wants to see you in his
rooms at once, sir!”</p>

<p>“That is deuced awkward,” said that gentleman
blandly. “Just excuse me for a moment or two,
Fazz.”</p>

<p>He hurried out, leaving Simpkins confronting Mr.
Zealander in some confusion. Fazz poked his
flaming coal. “This fire! Did you ever see such a
morbid conflagration?”</p>

<p>“Rather nice, I thought,” replied Simpkins
affably; “quite cool to-night, outside, rather.”</p>

<p>The host peered at him through those dim glasses.
“There’s a foggy humidity about everything, like
the inside of a cream tart. But sit down,” said Fazz,
With the geniality of a man who was about to be hung
and was rather glad that he was no longer to be
exposed to the fraudulent excess of life, “and tell me
a bawdy story.”</p>

<p>Simpkins sank into an armchair and was silent.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you don’t care for bawdy stories?”
continued Fazz. “I do, I do. I love vulgarity;
there is certainly a niche in life for vulgarity. If ever
I possess a house of my own I will arrange—I will,
upon my soul—one augustly vulgar room, divinely
vulgar, upholstered in sallow pigskin. Do tell me
something. You haven’t got a spanner on you, I
suppose? There is something the matter with my
bed. Once it was full of goose feathers, but now I
sleep, as it were, on the bulge of a barrel; I must do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
something to it with a spanner. I hate spanners—such
dreadful democratic tools; they terrify me, they
gape at you as if they wanted to bite you. Spanners
are made of iron, and this is a funny world, for it is
full of things like spanners.”</p>

<p>Simpkins timidly rose up through the waves of this
discourse and asked if he could “do” anything.
He was mystified, amused, and impressed by this
person; he didn’t often meet people like that, he
didn’t often meet anybody; he rather liked him.
On each side of the invalid there were tables and
bottles of medicine.</p>

<p>“I am just going to take my temperature,” said
Fazz. “Do have a cigarette, dearie, or a cigar. Can
you see the matches? Yes; now do you mind
surrounding me with my medicines? They give
such a hopeful air to the occasion. There’s a phial
of sodium salicylate tabloids, I must take six of them
in a minute or two. Then there are the quinine
capsules; the formalin, yes; those lozenges I suck—have
one?—they are so comforting, and that depressing
laxative; surround me with them. Oh,
glorious, benignant, isn’t it? Now I shall take my
temperature; I shall be as stolid as the sphinx for
three minutes, so do tell me that story. Where is my
thermometer, oh!” He popped the thermometer
into his mouth, but pulled it out again. “Do you
know L. G.? He’s a blithe little fellow, oh, very
blithe. He was in Jacobsen’s rooms the other day—Jacobsen’s
a bit of an art connoisseur, you know, and
draws and paints, and Jacobsen drew attention to the
portrait of a lady that was hanging on the wall.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span> ‘Oh,
dear,’ said L. G., ‘what a hag! Where did you get
that thing?’ just like that. Such a perfect fool,
L. G. ‘It’s my mother,’ says Jacobsen. ‘Oh, of
course,’ explained L. G., ‘I didn’t mean <i>that</i>, of
course, my dear fellow; I referred to the horrible
treatment, entirely to the horrible treatment; it is a
wretched daub.’ ‘I did it myself!’ said Jacobsen.
You don’t know L. G.? Oh, he is very blithe.
What were you going to tell me? I am just going
to take my temperature; yesterday it was ninety
odd point something. I do hope it is different
now. I can’t bear those points, they seem so
equivocal.”</p>

<p>Fazz sat with the tube of the thermometer projecting
from his mouth. At the end of the test he
regarded it very earnestly before returning it disconsolately
to the table. Then he addressed his
visitor with considerable gloom.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, I did not catch your name.”</p>

<p>“Simpkins.”</p>

<p>“Simpkins!” repeated Fazz, with a dubious
drawl. “Oh, I’m sorry, I don’t like Simpkins, it
sounds so minuscular. What are you taking?”</p>

<p>“I won’t take anything, sir, thank you,” replied
Simpkins.</p>

<p>“I mean, what schools are you taking?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no school at all.”</p>

<p>Fazz was mystified: “What college are you?”</p>

<p>“I’m not at a college,” confessed the other. “I
came to see Mr. Evans-Antrobus with a note. I’m
waiting for an answer.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>
<p>“Where do you come from?”</p>

<p>“From Bagshot and Buffle’s.” After a silence he
added: “Bespoke boots.”</p>

<p>“Hump, you are very young to make bespoke
boots, aren’t you, Simpkins, surely? Are you an
Agnostic? Have a cigar? You must, you’ve been
very good, and I am so interested in your career;
but tell me now what it exactly is that you are sitting
in my room for?”</p>

<p>Simpkins told him all he could.</p>

<p>“It’s interesting, most fascinating,” declared
Fazz, “but it is a little beyond me all the same. I am
afraid, Simpkins, that you have been deposited with
me as if I were a bank and you were something not
negotiable, as you really are, I fear. But you mustn’t
tell the Dean about Evans-Antrobus, no, you mustn’t,
it’s never done. Tell me, why do you make bespoke
boots? It’s an unusual taste to display. Wouldn’t
you rather come to college, for instance, and study
... er ... anthropology—nothing at all about boots
in anthropology?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Simpkins. He shuffled in his chair
and felt uneasy. “I’d be out of my depth.” Fazz
glared at him, and Simpkins repeated: “Out of my
depth, that would be, sure.”</p>

<p>“This is very shameful,” commented the other,
“but it’s interesting, most fascinating. You brazenly
maintain that you would rather study boots than ...
than books and brains!”</p>

<p>“A cobbler must stick to his last,” replied Simpkins,
recalling a phrase of his father’s.</p>

<p>“Bravo!” cried Fazz,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span> “but not to an everlasting
last!”</p>

<p>“And I don’t know anything about all this;
there’s nothing about it I’d want to know, it wouldn’t
be any good to me. It’s no use mixing things, and
there’s a lot to be learnt about boots—you’d be surprised.
You got to keep yourself to yourself and not
get out of your depth—take a steady line and stick
to it, and not get out of your depth.”</p>

<p>“But, dearie, you don’t sleep with a lifebelt girt
about your loins, do you now? I’m not out of my
depth; I shouldn’t be even if I started to make
boots....”</p>

<p>“Oh, wouldn’t you?” shouted Simpkins.</p>

<p>“I should find it rather a shallow occupation;
mere business is the very devil of a business; business
would be a funny sort of life.”</p>

<p>“Life’s a funny business; you look after your
business and that will look after you.”</p>

<p>“But what in the world are we in the world at all
for, Simpkins? Isn’t it surely to do just the things
we most intensely want to do? And you do boots
and boots and boots. Don’t you ever get out and
about?—theatres—girls—sport—or do you insist on
boot, the whole boot, and nothing but boot?”</p>

<p>“No, none of them,” replied Simpkins. “Don’t
care for theatres, I’ve never been. Don’t care for
girls, I like a quiet life. I keep myself to myself—it’s
safer, don’t get out of your depth then. I do go
and have a look at the football match sometimes, but
it’s only because we make the boots for some of your
crack players, and you want to know what you are
making them for. Work doesn’t trouble me, nothing
troubles me, and I got money in the bank.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<p>“Damme, Simpkins, you have a terrible conviction
about you; if I listen to you much longer I shall bind
myself apprentice to you. I feel sure that you
make nice, soft, watertight, everlasting boots,
and then we should rise in the profession together.
Discourse, Simpkins; you enchant mine ears—both
of them.”</p>

<p>“What I say is,” concluded Simpkins, “you can’t
understand everything. I shouldn’t want to; I’m
all right as it is.”</p>

<p>“Of course you are, you’re simply too true. This
is a place flowing with afternoon tea, tutors, and clap-trap.
It’s a city in which everything is set upon a
bill. You’re simply too true, if we are not out of our
depth we are in up to our ears—I am. It’s most
fascinating.”</p>

<p>Soon afterwards Simpkins left him. Descending
the stairs to the rooms of Evans-Antrobus he
switched on the light. It was very quiet and snug
in those rooms, with the soft elegant couch, the
reading-lamp with the delicious violet shade, the
decanter with whiskey, the box of chocolate biscuits,
and the gramophone. He sat down by the fire,
waiting and waiting. Simpkins waited so long that
he got used to the room, he even stole a sip of
whiskey and some of the chocolate biscuits. Then to
show his independence, his contempt for Mr. Evans-Antrobus
and his trickery, he took still more of the
whiskey—a drink he had never tasted before—he
really took quite a lot. He heaped coal upon the fire,
and stalked about the room with his hands in his
pockets or examined the books, most of which were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
about something called Jurisprudence, and suchlike.
Simpkins liked books; he began reading:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That the Pleuronectidæ are admirably adapted by their
flattened and asymmetrical structure for their habits of life,
is manifest from several species, such as soles and flounders,
etc., being extremely common.</p></blockquote>

<p>He did not care much for science; he opened
another:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is difficult indeed to imagine that anything can
oscillate so rapidly as to strike the retina of the eye
831,479,000,000,000 in one second, as must be the case with
violet light according to this hypothesis.</p></blockquote>

<p>Simpkins looked at the light and blinked his eyes.
That had a violet shade. He really did not care for
science, and he had an inclination to put the book
down as his head seemed to be swaying, but he
continued to turn the pages.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Snowdon is the highest mountain in England or Wales.
Snowdon is not so high as Ben Nevis.</p>

<p>Therefore the highest mountain in England or Wales is
not so high as Ben Nevis.</p></blockquote>

<p>“Oh, my head!” mumbled Simpkins.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Water must be either warm or not warm, but it does not
follow that it must be warm or cold.</p></blockquote>

<p>Simpkins felt giddy. He dropped the book, and
tottered to the couch. Immediately the room spun
round and something in his head began to hum, to
roar like an aeroplane a long way up in the sky. He
felt that he ought to get out of the room, quickly, and
get some water, either not or cold warm—he did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>n’t
mind which! He clapped on his hat and, slipping
into his overcoat, he reached a door. It opened into a
bedroom, very bare indeed compared with this other
room, but Simpkins rolled in; the door slammed
behind him, and in the darkness he fell upon a bed,
with queer sensations that seemed to be dividing and
subtracting in him.</p>

<p>When he awoke later—oh, it seemed much later—he
felt quite well again. He had forgotten where he
was. It was a strange place he was in, utterly dark;
but there was a great noise sounding quite close to
him—a gramophone, people shouting choruses and
dancing about in the adjoining room. He could hear
a lady’s voice too. Then he remembered that he
ought not to be in that room at all; it was, why, yes,
it was criminal; he might be taken for a burglar or
something! He slid from the bed, groped in the
darkness until he found his hat, unbuttoned his coat,
for he was fearfully hot, and stood at the bedroom
door trembling in the darkness, waiting and listening
to that tremendous row. He <i>had</i> been a fool to come
in there! How was he to get out—how the deuce
was he to get out? The gramophone stopped. He
could hear the voices more plainly. He grew silently
panic-stricken; it was awful, they’d be coming in to
him perhaps, and find him sneaking there like a thief—he
must get out, he must, he must get out; yes,
but how?</p>

<p>The singing began again. The men kept calling
out “Lulu! Lulu!” and a lady’s gay voice would
reply to a Charley or a George, and so on, when all
at once there came a peremptory knock at the outer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
door. The noise within stopped immediately. Deep
silence. Simpkins could hear whispering. The
people in there were startled; he could almost feel
them staring at each other with uneasiness. The
lady laughed out startlingly shrill. “Sh-s-s-sh!”
the others cried. The loud knocking began again,
emphatic, terrible. Simpkins’ already quaking
heart began to beat ecstatically. Why, oh why, didn’t
they open that door?—open it! open it! There was
shuffling in the room, and when the knocking was
repeated for the third time the outer door was
apparently unlocked.</p>

<p>“Fazz! Oh, Fazz, you brute!” cried the relieved
voices in the room. “You fool, Fazz! Come in,
damn you, and shut the door.”</p>

<p>“Good gracious!” exclaimed the apparently
deliberating Fazz, “what is that?”</p>

<p>“Hullo, Rob Roy!” cried the lady, “it’s me.”</p>

<p>“Charmed to meet you, madame. How interesting,
most fascinating; yes, I am quite charmed,
but I wish somebody would kindly give me the loose
end of it all. I’m suffering, as you see, dearies, and
I don’t understand all this, I’m quite out of my depth.
The noise you’ve been making is just crushing me.”</p>

<p>Several voices began to explain at once: “We
captured her, Fazz, yes—Rape of the Sabines, what!—from
the Vaudeville. Had a rag, glorious—corralled
all the attendants and scene-shifters—rushed
the stage—we did! we did!—everybody
chased somebody, and we chased Lulu—we did!
we did!”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up, everybody!” cried out Fazz.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span></p>

<p>“Yes, listen,” cried the voice of Evans-Antrobus.
“This is how it happened: they chased the eight
Sisters Victoria off the stage, and we spied dear little
Lulu—she was one of those eight Victorias—bolting
down a passage to the stage entrance. She fled into
the street just as she was—isn’t she a duck? There
was a taxi standing there, and Lulu, wise woman,
jumped in—and we jumped in too. (We did! We
did!) ‘Where for?’ says taximan. ‘Saviour’s
College,’ say we, and here you are—Lulu—what do
you think of her?”</p>

<p>“Charming, utterly charming,” replied Fazz.
“The details are most clarifying; but how did you
manage to usher her into the college?”</p>

<p>“My overcoat on,” explained one voice.</p>

<p>“And my hat,” cried another.</p>

<p>“And we dazzled the porter,” said a third. There
were lots of other jolly things to explain: Lulu had
not resisted at all, she had enjoyed it; it was a lark!</p>

<p>“Oh, beautiful! Most fascinating!” agreed
Fazz. “But how you propose to get her out of the
college I have no more notion than Satan has of
sanctity—it’s rather late, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Simpkins, in his dark room, could hear someone
rushing up the stairs with flying leaps that ceased at
the outer door. Then a breathless voice hissed out:
“You fellows, scat, scat! Police are in the lodge with
the proctors and that taximan!”</p>

<p>In a moment Evans-Antrobus began to groan.
“Oh, my God, what can we do with her? We must
get her out at once—over the wall, eh, at once, quick!
Johnstone, quick, go and find a rope, quick, a rope.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

<p>And Fazz said: “It does begin to look a little
foolish. Oh, I am feeling so damn bad—but you
can’t blame a fool for anything it does, can you?
But I am bad; I am going to bed instantly, I feel
quite out of my depth here. Oh, that young friend
of yours, that Simpkins, charming young person!
Very blithe he was, dear Evans-Antrobus!”</p>

<p>Everybody now seemed to rush away from the
room except the girl Lulu and Evans-Antrobus. He
was evidently very agitated and in a bad humour.
He clumped about the room exclaiming, “Oh,
damnation, do hurry up, somebody. What am I to
do with her, boozy little pig! Do hurry up!”</p>

<p>“Who’s a pig? I want to go out of here,”
shrilled Lulu, and apparently she made for the door.</p>

<p>“You can’t go like that!” he cried; “you can’t,
you mustn’t. Don’t be a fool, Lulu! Lulu! Now,
isn’t this a fearful mess?”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to stop here with you, ugly thing!
I don’t like it; I’m going now, let go.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t go, I tell you, in these things, not
like that. Let me think, let me think, can’t you!
Why don’t you let me think, you little fool! Put
something on you, my overcoat; cover yourself up.
I shall be ruined, damn you! Why the devil did you
come here, you ...!”</p>

<p>“And who brought me here, Mr. Antibus?
Oh yes, I know you; I shall have something to say
to the vicar, or whoever it is you’re afraid of, baby-face!
Let me go; I don’t want to be left here alone
with you!” she yelled. Simpkins heard an awful
scuffle. He could wait no longer; he flung open<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
the door, rushed into the room, and caught up a
syphon, the first handy weapon. They saw him at
once, and stood apart amazed.</p>

<p>“Fine game!” said the trembling Simpkins to the
man, with all the sternness at his command. As
nobody spoke he repeated, quite contemptuously:
“Fine game!”</p>

<p>Lulu was breathing hard, with her hands resting
upon her bosom. Her appearance was so startling
to the boy that he nearly dropped the syphon. He
continued to face her, hugging it with both hands
against his body. She was clad in pink tights—they
were of silk, they glistened in the sharper light from
under the violet shade—a soft white tarlatan skirt
that spread around her like a carnation, and a rose-coloured
bodice. She was dainty, with a little round
head and a little round face like a briar rose; but he
guessed she was strong, though her beauty had
apparently all the fragility of a flower. Her hair, of
dull dark gold, hung in loose tidiness without pin or
braid, the locks cut short to her neck, where they
curved in to brush the white skin; a deep straight
fringe of it was combed upon the childish brow. Grey
were her surprised eyes, and wide the pouting lips.
Her lovely naked arms—oh, he could scarcely bear
to look at them. She stood now, with one hand upon
her hip and the other lying against her cheek, staring
at Simpkins. Then she danced delightfully up to him
and took the syphon away.</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Evans-Antrobus to Lulu—he
had recovered his nerve, and did not express any
astonishment at Simpkins’ sudden appearance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>—“he
is just your size, you dress up in his clothes, quick,
then it’s simple.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the girl.</p>

<p>“And no for me,” said Simpkins fiercely—almost.</p>

<p>Just then the door was thrust partly open and a
rope was flung into the room. The bringer of it
darted away downstairs again.</p>

<p>“Hi! here!” called Evans-Antrobus, rushing to
the door; but nobody stayed for him, nobody
answered him. He came back and picked up the rope.</p>

<p>“Put on that coat,” he commanded Lulu, “and
that hat. Now, look here, not a word, not a giggle
even, or we are done, and I might just as well screw
your blessed neck!”</p>

<p>“Would you?” snorted Simpkins, with not a
little animosity.</p>

<p>“Yes, would you!” chimed Lulu, but nevertheless
she obeyed and followed him down the stairs.
When she turned and beckoned, Simpkins followed
too. They crossed a dark quadrangle, passed down a
passage that was utter darkness, through another quad,
another passage, and halted in a gloomy yard behind
the chapel, where Evans-Antrobus struck a match,
and where empty boxes, bottles, and other rubbish
had accumulated under a wall about ten feet high.</p>

<p>“You first, and quiet, quiet,” growled Evans-Antrobus
to Simpkins. No one spoke again. Night
was thickly dark, the stars were dim, the air moist
and chill. Simpkins, assisted by the other man,
clambered over rickety boxes and straddled the high
thick wall. The rope was hungover, too, and when
the big man had jumped to earth again, dragging his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
weight against it, Simpkins slid down on the other
side. He was now in a narrow street, with a dim
lamp at one end that cast no gleam to the spot where
he had descended. There were dark high-browed
buildings looming high around him. He stood holding
the end of the rope and looking up at the stars—very
faint they were. The wall was much higher on
this side, looked like a mountain, and he thought of
Ben Nevis again. This was out of your depth, if you
like, out of your depth entirely. It was all wrong
somehow, or, at any rate, it was not all right; it
couldn’t be right. Never again would he mess about
with a lot of lunatics. He hadn’t done any good, he
hadn’t even got the money—he had forgotten it.
He had not got anything at all except a headache.</p>

<p>The rope tightened. Lulu was astride the wall,
quarrelling with the man on the other side.</p>

<p>“Keep your rotten coat!” She slipped it off and
flung it down from the wall. “And your rotten hat,
too, spider-face!” She flung that down from the
wall, and spat into the darkness. Turning to the
other side, she whispered: “I’m coming,” and
scrambled down, sliding into Simpkins’ arms. And
somehow he stood holding her so, embracing her
quite tightly. She was all softness and perfume, he
could not let her go; she had scarcely anything on—he
would not let her go. It was marvellous and
beautiful to him; the glimmer of her white face was
mysterious and tender in the darkness. She put her
arms around his neck:</p>

<p>“Oh ... I rather love you,” she said.</p>

<h2 id="Simple_Simon"><i>Simple Simon</i></h2>


<p>This simple man lived lonely in a
hut in the depths of a forest, just underneath three
hovering trees, a pine tree and two beeches. The
sun never was clear in the forest, but the fogs that
rose in its unshaken shade were neither sweet nor
sour. Lonely was Simon, for he had given up all the
sweet of the world and had received none of the sweet
of heaven. Old now, and his house falling to ruin, he
said he would go seek the sweet of heaven, for what
was there in the mortal world to detain him? Not
peace, certainly, for time growled and scratched at
him like a mangy dog, and there were no memories
to cherish; he had had a heavy father, a mother who
was light, and never a lay-by who had not deceived
him. So he went in his tatters and his simplicity to
the lord of the manor.</p>

<p>“I’m bound for heaven, sir,” says Simon, “will
you give me an old coat, or an odd rag or so? There’s a
hole in my shoe, sir, and good fortune slips out of it.”</p>

<p>No—the lord of the manor said—he could not
give him a decent suit, nor a shoe, nor the rags
neither. Had he not let him dwell all life long in his
forest? With not a finger of rent coming? Snaring
the conies—(May your tongue never vex you, sir!)—and
devouring the birds—(May God see me, sir!)—and
cutting the fuel, snug as a bee in a big white hive.
(Never a snooze of sleep, with the wind howling in
the latch of it and the cracks gaping, sir!) What
with the taxes and the ways of women—said the lord—he
had but a scrimping time of it himself, so he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
had. There was neither malt in the kiln nor meal in
the hopper, and there were thieves in the parish.
Indeed, he would as lief go with Simon, but it was
such a diggins of a way off.</p>

<p>So Simon went walking on until he came to the
godly man who lived in a blessed mansion, full of
delights for the mind and eye as well as a deal of
comfort for his belly.</p>

<p>No—the godly man said—he would not give him
anything, for the Lord took no shame of a man’s
covering.</p>

<p>“Ah, but your holiness,” said Simon, “I’ve a care
to look decent when I go to the King of All.”</p>

<p>“My poor man, how will you get there, my poor
man?” he said.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” says Simon, “I’ll get a lift on my way.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get no lift,” the godly man said, “for it’s
a hard and lonely road to travel.”</p>

<p>“My sorrow! And I heard it was a good place to
go to!”</p>

<p>“It is a good place, my simple man, but the road
to it is difficult and empty and hard. You will get no
lift, you will lose your way, you will be taken with a
sickness.”</p>

<p>“Ah, and I heard it was a good kind road, and help
in the end of it and warmth and a snap of victuals.”</p>

<p>“No doubt, no doubt, but I tell you, don’t be
setting yourself up for to judge of it. Go back to
your home and be at peace with the world.”</p>

<p>“Mine’s all walk-on,” said Simon, and turning
away he looked towards his home. Distant or near
there was nothing he could see but trees, not a glint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
of sea, and little of sky, and nothing of a hill or the
roof of a friendly house—just a trap of trees as close
as a large hand held before a large face, beeches and
beeches, pines and pines. And buried in the middle
of it was a tiny hut, sour and broken; in the time of
storms the downpour would try to dash it into the
ground, and the wind would try to tear it out. Well,
he had had his enough of it, so he went to another
man, a scholar for learning, and told him his intentions
and his wishes.</p>

<p>“To heaven!” said the scholar. “Well, it’s a
fair day for that good-looking journey.”</p>

<p>“It is indeed a fine day,” said Simon. As clear as
crystal it was, yet soft and mellow as snuff.</p>

<p>“Then content you, man Simon, and stay in it.”</p>

<p>“Ah, sir,” he says, “I’ve a mind and a will that
makes me serve them.”</p>

<p>“Cats will mouse and larks will sing,” the scholar
said, “but you are neither the one nor the other.
What you seek is hidden, perhaps hidden for ever;
God remove discontent and greed from the world:
why should you look on the other side of a wall—what
is a wall for?”</p>

<p>The old man was silent.</p>

<p>“How long has this notion possessed you?”</p>

<p>The old man quavered “Since ... since ...” but
he could say no more. A green bird flew laughing
above them.</p>

<p>“What bird is that—what is it making that noise
for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

<p>“It is a woodpecker, sir; he knows he can sing a
song for Sixpence.”</p>

<p>The scholar stood looking up into the sky. His
boots were old—well, that is the doom of all boots,
just as it is of man. His clothes were out of fashion,
so was his knowledge; stripped of his gentle dignity
he was but dust and ashes.</p>

<p>“To travel from the world?” he was saying.
“That is not wise.”</p>

<p>“Ah, sir, wisdom was ever deluding me, for I’m
not more than half done—like a poor potato. First,
of course, there’s the things you don’t know; then
there’s the things you do know but can’t understand;
then there’s the things you do understand but which
don’t matter. Saving your presence, sir, there’s a
heap of understanding to be done before you’re
anything but a fool.”</p>

<p>“He is not a fool who is happy; mortal pleasures
decline as the bubble of knowledge grows; that’s the
long of it, and it’s the short of it too.”</p>

<p>Simon was silent, adding up the buttons on the
scholar’s tidy coat. He counted five of them, they
shone like gold and looked—oh, very well they
looked.</p>

<p>“I was happy once,” then he said. “Ah, and I
remember I was happy twice, yes, and three times I
was happy in this world. I was not happy since....”</p>

<p>“Yes, since what?” the scholar asked him: but
the old man was dumb.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Simon, what made you happy.”</p>

<p>“I was happy, sir, when I first dwelled in the wood
and made with my own hands a house of boards.
Why—you’d not believe—but it had a chimney then,
and was no ways draughty then, and was not creaky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
then, nor damp then; a good fine house with a door
and a half door, birds about it, magpies and tits and
fine boy blackbirds! A lake with a score of mallards
on it! And for conies and cushats you could take
your oath of a meal any day in the week, and twice a
day, any day. But ’tis falling with age and weather
now, I see it go; the rain wears it, the moss rots it,
the wind shatters it. The lake’s as dry as a hen’s foot,
and the forest changes. What was bushes is timber
now, and what was timber is ashes; the forest has
spread around me and the birds have left me and
gone to the border. As for conies, there’s no contriving
with those foxes and weasels so cunning at
them; not the trace of a tail, sir, nothing but snakes
and snails now. I was happy when I built that house;
that’s what I was; I was then.”</p>

<p>“Ah, so, indeed. And the other times—the
second time?”</p>

<p>“Why, that was the time I washed my feet in the
lake and I saw....”</p>

<p>“What, man Simon, what did you see?”</p>

<p>Simon passed his hand across his brow. “I see
... ah, well, I saw it. I saw something ... but I
forget.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you have forgotten your happiness,” said
the scholar in a soft voice: “Yes, yes.” He went on
speaking to himself: “Death is a naked Ethiope with
flaming hair. I don’t want to live for ever, but I
want to live.”</p>

<p>He took off his coat and gave it to Simon, who
thanked him and put it on. It seemed a very heavy
coat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

<p>“Maybe,” the old man mumbled, “I’ll get a lift
on the way.”</p>

<p>“May it be so. And good-bye to you,” said the
scholar, “’Tis as fine a day as ever came out of Eden.”</p>

<p>They parted so, and old Simon had not been gone
an hour when the scholar gave a great shout and
followed after him frantic, but he could not come up
with him, for Simon had gone up in a lift to heaven—a
lift with cushions in it, and a bright young girl
guiding the lift, dressed like a lad, but with a sad
stern voice.</p>

<p>Several people got into the lift, the most of them
old ladies, but no children, so Simon got in too and
sat on a cushion of yellow velvet. And he was near
sleeping when the lift stopped of a sudden and a lady
who was taken sick got out. “Drugs and lounge!”
the girl called out, “Second to the right and keep
straight on. Going up?”</p>

<p>But though there was a crowd of young people
waiting nobody else got in. They slid on again,
higher and much higher. Simon dropped into sleep
until the girl stopped at the fourth floor: “Refreshments,”
she said, “and Ladies’ Cloak Room!” All
the passengers got out except Simon: he sat still
until they came to the floor of heaven. There he
got out, and the girl waved her hand to him and said
“Good-bye.” A few people got in the lift. “Going
down?” she cried. Then she slammed the door and
it sank into a hole and Simon never laid an eye on it
or her from that day for ever.</p>

<p>Now it was very pleasant where he found himself,
very pleasant indeed and in no ways different from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
fine parts of the earth. He went onwards and the
first place he did come to was a farmhouse with a
kitchen door. He knocked and it was opened. It
was a large kitchen; it had a cracked stone floor and
white rafters above it with hooks on them and shearing
irons and a saddle. And there was a smoking
hearth and an open oven with bright charred wood
burning in it, a dairy shelf beyond with pans of
cream, a bed of bracken for a dog in the corner by the
pump, and a pet sheep wandering about. It had the
number 100 painted on its fleece and a loud bell was
tinkling round its neck. There was a fine young girl
stood smiling at him; the plait of her hair was thick
as a rope of onions and as shining with the glint in it.
Simon said to her: “I’ve been a-walking, and I seem
to have got a bit dampified like, just a touch o’ damp
in the knees of my breeches, that’s all.”</p>

<p>The girl pointed to the fire and he went and dried
himself. Then he asked the girl if she would give
him a true direction, and so she gave him a true
direction and on he went. And he had not gone far
when he saw a place just like the old forest he had
come from, but all was delightful and sunny, and
there was the house he had once built, as beautiful
and new, with the shining varnish on the door, a
pool beyond, faggots and logs in the yard, and inside
the white shelves were loaded with good food, the
fire burning with a sweet smell, and a bed of rest in
the ingle. Soon he was slaking his hunger; then he
hung up his coat on a peg of iron, and creeping into
the bed he went into the long sleep in his old happy
way of sleeping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

<p>But all this time the scholar was following after
him, searching under the sun, and from here to
there, calling out high and low, and questioning the
travelling people: had they seen a simple man, an
old man who had been but three times happy?—but
not a one had seen him. He was cut to the heart with
anxiety, with remorse, and with sorrow, for in a
secret pocket of the coat he had given to Simon he
had left—unbeknown, but he remembered it now—a
wallet of sowskin, full of his own black sins, and
nothing to distinguish them in any way from any
other man’s. It was a dark load upon his soul that
the poor man might be punished with an everlasting
punishment for having such a tangle of wickedness
on him and he unable to explain it. An old man like
that, who had been happy but the three times! He
enquired upon his right hand, and upon his left hand
he enquired, but not a walking creature had seen
him and the scholar was mad vexed with shame.
Well, he went on, and on he went, but he did not get
a lift on the way. He went howling and whistling
like a man who would frighten all the wild creatures
down into the earth, and at last he came by a back way
to the borders of heaven. There he was, all of a day
behind the man he was pursuing, in a great wilderness
of trees. It began to rain, a soft meandering fall
that you would hardly notice for rain, but the birds
gave over their whistling and a strong silence grew
everywhere, hushing things. His footfall as he
stumbled through briars and the wild gardens of the
wood seemed to thump the whole earth, and he could
hear all the small noises like the tick of a beetle and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
the gasping of worms. In a grove of raspberry canes
he stood like a stock with the wonder of that stillness.
Clouds did not move, he could but feel the rain that
he could not see. Each leaf hung stiff as if it was
frozen, though it was summer. Not a living thing
was to be seen, and the things that were not living
were not more dead than those that lived but were so
secret still. He picked a few berries from the canes,
and from every bush as he pulled and shook it a
butterfly or a moth dropped or fluttered away, quiet
and most ghostly. “An old bit of a man”—he kept
repeating in his mind—“with three bits of joy, an
old bit of a man.”</p>

<p>Suddenly a turtle dove with clatter enough for a
goose came to a tree beside him and spoke to him!
A young dove, and it crooed on the tree branch, croo,
croo, croo, and after each cadence it heaved the air
into its lungs again with a tiny sob. Well, it would
be no good telling what the bird said to the scholar,
for none would believe it, they could not; but speak
it did. After that the scholar tramped on, and on
again, until he heard voices close ahead from a group
of frisky boys who were chasing a small bird that
could hardly fly. As the scholar came up with them
one of the boys dashed out with his cap and fell upon
the fledgling and thrust it in his pocket.</p>

<p>Now, by God, that scholar was angry, for a thing
he liked was the notes of birds tossed from bush to
bush like aery bubbles, and he wrangled with the
boy until the little lad took the crumpled bird out of
his pocket and flung it saucily in the air as you would
fling a stone. Down dropped the bird into a gulley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
as if it was shot, and the boys fled off. The scholar
peered into the gulley, but he could not see the young
finch, not a feather of it. Then he jumped into the
gulley and stood quiet, listening to hear it cheep, for
sure a wing would be broken, or a foot. But nothing
could he see, nothing, though he could hear hundreds
of grasshoppers leaping among the dead leaves with a
noise like pattering rain. So he turned away, but
as he shifted his foot he saw beneath it the shattered
bird: he had jumped upon it himself and destroyed
it. He could not pick it up, it was bloody; he leaned
over it, sighing: “Poor bird, poor bird, and is this
your road to heaven? Or do you never share the
heaven that you make?” There was a little noise
then added to the leaping of the grasshoppers—it
was the patter of tears he was shedding from himself.
Well, when the scholar heard that he gave a good
shout of laughter, and he was soon contented, forgetting
the bird. He was for sitting down awhile
but the thought of the old man Simon, with that
sinful wallet—a rare budget of his own mad joys—urged
him on till he came by the end of the wood,
the rain ceasing, and beyond him the harmony of a
flock roaming and bleating. Every ewe of the flock
had numbers painted on it, that ran all the way up to
ninety and nine.</p>

<p>Soon he came to the farmhouse and the kitchen
and the odd sheep and a kind girl with a knot of hair
as thick as a twist of bread. He told her the thing
that was upon his conscience.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span></p>
<p>“Help me to come up with him, for I’m a day
to the bad, and what shall I do? I gave him a coat,
an old coat, and all my sins were hidden in it, but
I’d forgotten them. He was an old quavering man
with but three spells of happiness in the earthly
world.” He begged her to direct him to the man
Simon. The smiling girl gave him a good direction,
the joyful scholar hurried out and on, and in a score
of minutes he was peeping in the fine hut, with his
hand on the latch of the half door, and Simon snoring
in bed, a quiet decent snore.</p>

<p>“Simon!” he calls, but he didn’t wake. He
shook him, but he didn’t budge. There was the coat
hanging down from the iron peg, so he went to it
and searched it and took out the wallet. But when
he opened it—a black sowskin wallet it was, very
strong with good straps—his sins were all escaped
from it, not one little sin left in the least chink of the
wallet, it was empty as a drum. The scholar knew
something was wrong, for it was full once, and quite
full.</p>

<p>“Well, now,” thought he, scratching his head
and searching his mind, “did I make a mistake of it?
Would they be by chance in the very coat that is on
me now, for I’ve not another coat to my name?” He
gave it a good strong search, in the patch pockets and
the inside pockets and in the purse on his belt, but
there was not the scrap of a tail of a sin of any sort,
good or bad, in that coat, and all he found was a few
cachous against the roughening of his voice.</p>

<p>“Did I make another mistake of it,” he says again,
“and put those solemn sins in the fob of my fancy
waistcoat? Where are they?” he shouts out.</p>

<p>Simon lifted his head out of sleeping for a moment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
“It was that girl with the hair,” Simon said. “She
took them from the wallet—they are not allowed in
this place—and threw them in the pigwash.”</p>

<p>With that he was asleep again, snoring his decent
snore.</p>

<p>“Glory be to God,” said the scholar, “am I not a
great fool to have come to heaven looking for my
sins!”</p>

<p>He took the empty wallet and tiptoed back to the
world, and if he is not with the saints yet, it is with the
saints he will be one day—barring he gets another
budget of sins in his eager joy. And <i>that</i> I wouldn’t
deny him.</p>

<h2 id="The_Tiger"><i>The Tiger</i></h2>


<p>The tiger was coming at last;
the almost fabulous beast, the subject of so much
conjecture for so many months, was at the docks
twenty miles away. Yak Pedersen had gone to fetch
it, and Barnabe Woolf’s Menagerie was about to
complete its unrivalled collection by the addition of a
full-grown Indian tiger of indescribable ferocity,
newly trapped in the forest and now for the first
time exhibited, and so on, and so on. All of which,
as it happened, was true. On the previous day
Pedersen the Dane and some helpers had taken a
brand new four-horse exhibition waggon, painted and
carved with extremely legendary tigers lapped in
blood—even the bars were gilded—to convey this
unmatchable beast to its new masters. The show
had had to wait a long time for a tiger, but it had got a
beauty at last, a terror indeed by all accounts, though
it is not to be imagined that everything recorded of it
by Barnabe Woolf was truth and nothing but truth.
Showmen do not work in that way.</p>

<p>Yak Pedersen was the tamer and menagerie
manager, a tall, blonde, angular man about thirty-five,
of dissolute and savage blood himself, with the very
ample kind of moustache that bald men often
develop; yes, bald, intemperate, lewd, and an
interminable smoker of Cuban cigarettes, which
seemed constantly to threaten a conflagration in that
moustache. Marie the Cossack hated him, but Yak
loved her with a fierce deep passion. Nobody knew
why she was called Marie the Cossack. She came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
from Canning Town—everybody knew that, and her
proper name was Fascota, Mrs. Fascota, wife of
Jimmy Fascota, who was the architect and carpenter
and builder of the show. Jimmy was not much to
look at, so little in fact that you couldn’t help wondering
what it was Marie had seen in him when she
could have had the King of Poland, as you might say,
almost for the asking. But still Jimmy was the boss
ganger of the show, and even that young gentleman
in frock coat and silk hat who paraded the platform
entrance to the arena and rhodomontadoed you into
it, often against your will, by the seductive recital of
the seven ghastly wonders of the world, all certainly
to be seen, to be seen inside, waiting to be seen, must
be seen, roll up—even he was subject to the commands
of Jimmy Fascota when the time came to
dismantle and pack up the show, although the transfer
of his activities involved him temporarily in a
change, a horrid change, of attire and language.
Marie was not a lady, but she was not for Pedersen
anyway. She swore like a factory foreman, or a
young soldier, and when she got tipsy she was full of
freedoms. By the power of God she was beautiful,
and by the same gracious power she was virtuous.
Her husband knew it; he knew all about master
Pedersen’s passion, too, and it did not even interest
him. Marie did feats in the lion cages, whipping
poor decrepit beasts, desiccated by captivity, through
a hoop or over a stick of wood and other kindergarten
disportings; but there you are, people must live,
and Marie lived that way. Pedersen was always
wooing her. Sometimes he was gracious and kind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
but at other times when his failure wearied him he
would be cruel and sardonic, with a suggestive tongue
whose vice would have scourged her were it not that
Marie was impervious, or too deeply inured to mind
it. She always grinned at him and fobbed him off
with pleasantries, whether he was amorous or
acrid.</p>

<p>“God Almighty!” he would groan, “she is not
good for me, this Marie. What can I do for her?
She is burning me alive and the Skaggerack could not
quench me, not all of it. The devil! What can I
do with this? Some day I shall smash her across the
eyes, yes, across the eyes.”</p>

<p>So you see the man really loved her.</p>

<p>When Pedersen returned from the docks the car
with its captive was dragged to a vacant place in the
arena, and the wooden front panel was let down from
the bars. The marvellous tiger was revealed. It
sprung into a crouching attitude as the light surprised
the appalling beauty of its smooth fox-coloured
coat, its ebony stripes, and snowy pads and belly.
The Dane, who was slightly drunk, uttered a yell and
struck the bars of the cage with his whip. The tiger
did not blench, but all the malice and ferocity in the
world seemed to congregate in its eyes and impress
with a pride and ruthless grandeur the colossal
brutality of its face. It did not move its body, but its
tail gradually stiffened out behind it as stealthily as
fire moves in the forest undergrowth, and the hair
along the ridge of its back rose in fearful spikes.
There was the slightest possible distension of the
lips, and it fixed its marvellous baleful gaze upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
Pedersen. The show people were hushed into
silence, and even Pedersen was startled. He showered
a few howls and curses at the tiger, who never
ceased to fix him with eyes that had something of
contempt in them and something of a horrible presage.
Pedersen was thrusting a sharp spike through the
bars when a figure stepped from the crowd. It was
an old negro, a hunchback with a white beard, dressed
in a red fez cap, long tunic of buff cotton, and blue
trousers. He laid both his hands on the spike and
shook his head deprecatingly, smiling all the while.
He said nothing, but there was nothing he could say—he
was dumb.</p>

<p>“Let him alone, Yak; let the tiger alone, Yak!”
cried Barnabe Woolf. “What is this feller?”</p>

<p>Pedersen with some reluctance turned from the
cage and said: “He is come with the animal.”</p>

<p>“So?” said Barnabe. “Vell, he can go. Ve do
not vant any black feller.”</p>

<p>“He cannot speak—no tongue—it is gone,” Yak
replied.</p>

<p>“No tongue! Vot, have they cut him out?”</p>

<p>“I should think it,” said the tamer. “There was
two of them, a white keeper, but that man fell off the
ship one night and they do not see him any more.
This chap he feed it and look after it. No information
of him, dumb you see, and a foreigner; don’t
understand. He have no letters, no money, no name,
nowheres to go. Dumb, you see, he has nothing,
nothing but a flote. The captain said to take him
away with us. Give a job to him, he is a proposition.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span></p>
<p>“Vot is he got you say?”</p>

<p>“Flote.” Pedersen imitated with his fingers and
lips the actions of a flute-player.</p>

<p>“O ya, a vloot! Vell, ve don’t want no vloots
now; ve feeds our own tigers, don’t ve, Yak?”
And Mr. Woolf, oily but hearty—and well he might
be so for he was beautifully rotund, hair like satin,
extravagantly clothed, and rich with jewellery—surveyed
first with a contemplative grin, and then
compassionately, the figure of the old negro, who
stood unsmiling with his hands crossed humbly
before him. Mr. Woolf was usually perspiring, and
usually being addressed by perspiring workmen,
upon whom he bellowed orders and such anathemas
as reduced each recipient to the importance of a
potato, and gave him the aspect of a consumptive
sheep. But to-day Mr. Woolf was affable and calm.
He took his cigar from his mouth and poured a flood
of rich grey air from his lips. “O ya, look after him
a day, or a couple of days.” At that one of the boys
began to lead the hunchback away as if he were a
horse. “Come on, Pompoon,” he cried, and thenceforward
the unknown negro was called by that name.</p>

<p>Throughout the day the tiger was the sensation of
the show, and the record of its ferocity attached to the
cage received thrilling confirmation whenever Pedersen
appeared before the bars. The sublime concentration
of hatred was so intense that children
screamed, women shuddered, and even men held
their breath in awe. At the end of the day the beasts
were fed. Great hacks of bloody flesh were forked
into the bottoms of the cages, the hungry victims
pouncing and snarling in ecstasy. But no sooner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
were they served than the front panel of each cage
was swung up, and the inmate in the seclusion of his
den slaked his appetite and slept. When the public
had departed the lights were put out and the doors
of the arena closed. Outside in the darkness only
its great rounded oblong shape could be discerned,
built high of painted wood, roofed with striped
canvas, and adorned with flags. Beyond this matchbox
coliseum was a row of caravans, tents, naphtha
flares, and buckets of fire on which suppers were
cooking. Groups of the show people sat or lounged
about, talking, cackling with laughter, and even
singing. No one observed the figure of Pompoon
as he passed silently on the grass. The outcast,
doubly chained to his solitariness by the misfortune of
dumbness and strange nationality, was hungry. He
had not tasted food that day. He could not understand
it any more than he could understand the
speech of these people. In the end caravan, nearest
the arena, he heard a woman quietly singing. He
drew a shining metal flute from his breast, but stood
silently until the singer ceased. Then he repeated
the tune very accurately and sweetly on his flute.
Marie the Cossack came to the door in her green
silk tights and high black boots with gilded fringes;
her black velvet doublet had plenty of gilded buttons
upon it. She was a big, finely moulded woman, her
dark and splendid features were burned healthily by
the sun. In each of her ears two gold discs tinkled and
gleamed as she moved. Pompoon opened his mouth
very widely and supplicatingly; he put his hand
upon his stomach and rolled his eyes so dreadfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
that Mrs. Fascota sent her little daughter Sophy
down to him with a basin of soup and potatoes.
Sophy was partly undressed, in bare feet and red
petticoat. She stood gnawing the bone of a chicken,
and grinning at the black man as he swallowed and
dribbled as best he could without a spoon. She cried
out: “Here, he’s going to eat the bloody basin and
all, mum!” Her mother cheerfully ordered her to
“give him those fraggiments, then!” The child
did so, pausing now and again to laugh at the satisfied
roll of the old man’s eyes. Later on Jimmy Fascota
found him a couple of sacks, and Pompoon slept
upon them beneath their caravan. The last thing the
old man saw was Pedersen, carrying a naphtha flare,
unlocking a small door leading into the arena, and
closing it with a slam after he had entered. Soon the
light went out.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>After a week the show shifted and Pompoon
accompanied it. Mrs. Kavanagh, who looked after
the birds, was, a little fortunately for him, kicked in
the stomach by a mule and had to be left at an infirmary.
Pompoon, who seemed to understand birds,
took charge of the parakeets, love birds, and other
highly coloured fowl, including the quetzal with
green mossy head, pink breast, and flowing tails, and
the primrose-breasted toucans with bills like a
butcher’s cleaver.</p>

<p>The show was always moving on and moving on.
Putting it up and taking it down was a more entertaining
affair than the exhibition itself. With<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
Jimmy Fascota in charge, and the young man of the
frock coat in an ecstasy of labour, half-clothed husky
men swarmed up the rigged frameworks, dismantling
poles, planks, floors, ropes, roofs, staging, tearing at
bolts and bars, walking at dizzying altitudes on
narrow boards, swearing at their mates, staggering
under vast burdens, sweating till they looked like
seals, packing and disposing incredibly of it all,
furling the flags, rolling up the filthy awnings,
then Right O! for a market town twenty miles
away.</p>

<p>In the autumn the show would be due at a great
gala town in the north, the supreme opportunity of
the year, and by that time Mr. Woolf expected to
have a startling headline about a new tiger act and the
intrepid tamer. But somehow Pedersen could make
no progress at all with this. Week after week went
by, and the longer he left that initial entry into the
cage of the tiger, notwithstanding the comforting
support of firearms and hot irons, the more remote
appeared the possibility of its capitulation. The
tiger’s hatred did not manifest itself in roars and
gnashing of teeth, but by its rigid implacable pose
and a slight flexion of its protruded claws. It
seemed as if endowed with an imagination of blood-lust,
Pedersen being the deepest conceivable excitation
of this. Week after week went by and the show
people became aware that Pedersen, their Pedersen,
the unrivalled, the dauntless tamer, had met his
match. They were proud of the beast. Some said
it was Yak’s bald crown that the tiger disliked, but
Marie swore it was his moustache, a really remarkable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
piece of hirsute furniture, that he would not have
parted with for a pound of gold—so he said. But
whatever it was—crown, moustache, or the whole
conglomerate Pedersen—the tiger remarkably loathed
it and displayed his loathing, while the unfortunate
tamer had no more success with it than he had ever
had with Marie the Cossack, though there was at
least a good humour in her treatment of him which
was horribly absent from the attitude of the beast.
For a long time Pedersen blamed the hunchback for
it all. He tried to elicit from him by gesticulations in
front of the cage the secret of the creature’s enmity,
but the barriers to their intercourse were too great
to be overcome, and to all Pedersen’s illustrative
frenzies Pompoon would only shake his sad head and
roll his great eyes until the Dane would cuff him
away with a curse of disgust and turn to find the eyes
of the tiger, the dusky, smooth-skinned tiger with
bitter bars of ebony, fixed upon him with tenfold
malignity. How he longed in his raging impotence
to transfix the thing with a sharp spear through the
cage’s gilded bars, or to bore a hole into its vitals
with a red-hot iron! All the traditional treatment in
such cases, combined first with starvation and then
with rich feeding, proved unavailing. Pedersen
always had the front flap of the cage left down at
night so that he might, as he thought, establish some
kind of working arrangement between them by the
force of propinquity. He tried to sleep on a bench
just outside the cage, but the horror of the beast so
penetrated him that he had to turn his back upon it.
Even then the intense enmity pierced the back of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
brain and forced him to seek a bench elsewhere out of
range of the tiger’s vision.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the derision of Marie was not concealed—it
was even blatant—and to the old contest
of love between herself and the Dane was now added
a new contest of personal courage, for it had come to
be assumed, in some undeclarable fashion, that if Yak
Pedersen could not tame that tiger, then Marie the
Cossack would. As this situation crystallized daily
the passion of Pedersen changed to jealousy and
hatred. He began to regard the smiling Marie in
much the same way as the tiger regarded him.</p>

<p>“The hell-devil! May some lightning scorch her
like a toasted fish!”</p>

<p>But in a short while this mood was displaced by
one of anxiety; he became even abject. Then,
strangely enough, Marie’s feelings underwent some
modification. She was proud of the chance to
subdue and defeat him, but it might be at a great
price—too great a price for her. Addressing herself
in turn to the dim understanding of Pompoon she had
come to perceive that he believed the tiger to be not
merely quite untamable, but full of mysterious
dangers. She could not triumph over the Dane
unless she ran the risk he feared to run. The risk
was colossal then, and with her realization of this
some pity for Yak began to exercise itself in her;
after all, were they not in the same boat? But the
more she sympathized the more she jeered. The
thing had to be done somehow.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Barnabe Woolf wants that headline
for the big autumn show, and a failure will mean a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
nasty interview with that gentleman. It may end by
Barnabe kicking Yak Pedersen out of his wild beast
show. Not that Mr. Woolf is so gross as to suggest
that. He senses the difficulty, although his manager
in his pride will not confess to any. Mr. Woolf
declares that his tiger is a new tiger; Yak must watch
out for him, be careful. He talks as if it were just
a question of giving the cage a coat of whitewash.
He never hints at contingencies; but still, there is
his new untamed tiger, and there is Mr. Yak Pedersen,
his wild beast tamer—at present.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>One day the menagerie did not open. It had
finished an engagement, and Jimmy Fascota had
gone off to another town to arrange the new pitch.
The show folk made holiday about the camp, or
flocked into the town for marketing or carousals.
Mrs. Fascota was alone in her caravan, clothed in her
jauntiest attire. She was preparing to go into the
town when Pedersen suddenly came silently in and
sat down.</p>

<p>“Marie,” he said, after a few moments, “I give
up that tiger. To me he has given a spell. It is like
a mesmerize.” He dropped his hands upon his
knees in complete humiliation. Marie did not speak,
so he asked: “What you think?”</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders, and put her brown
arms akimbo. She was a grand figure so, in a cloak
of black satin and a huge hat trimmed with crimson
feathers.</p>

<p>“If <i>you</i> can’t trust him,” she said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span> “who can?”</p>

<p>“It is myself I am not to trust. Shameful! But
that tiger will do me, yes, so I will not conquer him.
It’s bad, very, very bad, is it not so? Shameful, but
I will not do it!” he declared excitedly.</p>

<p>“What’s Barnabe say?”</p>

<p>“I do not care, Mr. Woolf can think what he can
think! Damn Woolf! But for what I do think of
my own self.... Ah!” He paused for a moment,
dejected beyond speech. “Yes, miserable it is, in
my own heart very shameful, Marie. And what
you think of me, yes, that too!”</p>

<p>There was a note in his voice that almost confounded
her—why, the man was going to cry!
In a moment she was all melting compassion and
bravado.</p>

<p>“You leave the devil to me, Yak. What’s come
over you, man? God love us, I’ll tiger him!”</p>

<p>But the Dane had gone as far as he could go. He
could admit his defeat, but he could not welcome her
all too ready amplification of it.</p>

<p>“Na, na, you are good for him, Marie, but you
beware. He is not a tiger; he is beyond everything,
foul—he has got a foul heart and a thousand demons
in it. I would not bear to see you touch him; no,
no, I would not bear it!”</p>

<p>“Wait till I come back this afternoon—you wait!”
cried Marie, lifting her clenched fist. “So help me,
I’ll tiger him, you’ll see!”</p>

<p>Pedersen suddenly awoke to her amazing attraction.
He seized her in his arms. “Na, na, Marie! God
above! I will not have it.”</p>

<p>“Aw, shut up!” she commanded, impatiently, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
pushing him from her she sprang down the steps and
proceeded to the town alone.</p>

<p>She did not return in the afternoon; she did not
return in the evening; she was not there when the
camp closed up for the night. Sophy, alone, was
quite unconcerned. Pompoon sat outside the
caravan, while the flame of the last lamp was perishing
weakly above his head. He now wore a coat of shag-coloured
velvet. He was old and looked very wise,
often shaking his head, not wearily, but as if in doubt.
The flute lay glittering upon his knees and he was
wiping his lips with a green silk handkerchief when
barefoot Sophy in her red petticoat crept behind
him, unhooked the lamp, and left him in darkness.
Then he departed to an old tent the Fascotas had
found for him.</p>

<p>When the mother returned the camp was asleep
in its darkness and she was very drunk. Yak
Pedersen had got her. He carried her into the
arena, and bolted and barred the door.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Marie Fascota awoke next morning in broad
daylight; through chinks and rents in the canvas
roof of the arena the brightness was beautiful to
behold. She could hear a few early risers bawling
outside, while all around her the caged beasts and
birds were squeaking, whistling, growling, and
snarling. She was lying beside the Dane on a great
bundle of straw. He was already awake when she
became aware of him, watching her with amused eyes.</p>

<p>“Yak Pedersen! Was I drunk?” Marie asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
dazedly in low husky tones, sitting up. “What’s
this, Yak Pedersen? Was I drunk? Have I been
here all night?”</p>

<p>He lay with his hands behind his head, smiling
in the dissolute ugliness of his abrupt yellow skull so
incongruously bald, his moustache so profuse, his
nostrils and ears teeming with hairs.</p>

<p>“Can’t you speak?” cried the wretched woman.
“What game do you call this? Where’s my Sophy,
and my Jimmy—is he back?”</p>

<p>Again he did not answer; he stretched out a hand
to caress her. Unguarded as he was, Marie smashed
down both her fists full upon his face. He lunged
back blindly at her and they both struggled to their
feet, his fingers clawing in her thick strands of hair
as she struck at him in frenzy. Down rolled the
mass and he seized it; it was her weakness, and she
screamed. Marie was a rare woman—a match for
most men—but the capture of her hair gave her
utterly into his powerful hands. Uttering a torrent
of filthy oaths, Pedersen pulled the yelling woman
backwards to him and grasping her neck with both
hands gave a murderous wrench and flung her to
the ground. As she fell Marie’s hand clutched a
small cage of fortune-telling birds. She hurled this
at the man, but it missed him; the cage burst against
a pillar and the birds scattered in the air.</p>

<p>“Marie! Marie!” shouted Yak, “listen! listen!”</p>

<p>Remorsefully he flung himself before the raging
woman who swept at him with an axe, her hair
streaming, her eyes blazing with the fire of a thousand
angers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span></p>

<p>“Drunk, was I!” she screamed at him. “That’s
how ye got me, Yak Pedersen? Drunk, was I!”</p>

<p>He warded the blow with his arm, but the shock
and pain of it was so great that his own rage burst
out again, and leaping at the woman he struck her a
horrible blow across the eyes. She sunk to her knees
and huddled there without a sound, holding her
hands to her bleeding face, her loose hair covering it
like a net. At the pitiful sight the Dane’s grief
conquered him again, and bending over her imploringly
he said: “Marie, my love, Marie! Listen!
It is not true! Swear me to God, good woman, it is
not true, it is not possible! Swear me to God!” he
raged distractedly. “Swear me to God!” Suddenly
he stopped and gasped. They were in front of the
tiger’s cage, and Pedersen was as if transfixed by that
fearful gaze. The beast stood with hatred concentrated
in every bristling hair upon its hide, and
in its eyes a malignity that was almost incandescent.
Still as a stone, Marie observed this, and began to
creep away from the Dane, stealthily, stealthily.
On a sudden, with incredible agility, she sprang up
the steps of the tiger’s cage, tore the pin from the
catch, flung open the door, and, yelling in madness,
leapt in. As she did so, the cage emptied. In one
moment she saw Pedersen grovelling on his knees,
stupid, and the next....</p>

<p>All the hidden beasts, stirred by instinctive knowledge
of the tragedy, roared and raged. Marie’s
eyes and mind were opened to its horror. She
plugged her fingers into her ears; screamed; but
her voice was a mere wafer of sound in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
pandemonium. She heard vast crashes of someone
smashing in the small door of the arena, and then
swooned upon the floor of the cage.</p>

<p>The bolts were torn from their sockets at last, the
slip door swung back, and in the opening appeared
Pompoon, alone, old Pompoon, with a flaming lamp
and an iron spear. As he stepped forward into the
gloom he saw the tiger, dragging something in its
mouth, leap back into its cage.</p>

<h2 id="Mordecai_and_Cocking"><i>Mordecai and Cocking</i></h2>


<p>Two men sat one afternoon
beside a spinney of beeches near the top of a wild
bare down. Old shepherd Mordecai was admonishing
a younger countryman, Eustace Cocking,
now out of work, who held beside him in leash a
brindled whippet dog, sharp featured and lean, its
neck clipped in a broad leather collar. The day was
radiant, the very air had bloom; bright day is never
so bright as upon these lonely downs, and the grim
face of storm never so tragic elsewhere. From the
beeches other downs ranged in every direction,
nothing but downs in beautiful abandoned masses.
In a valley below the men a thousand sheep were
grazing; they looked no more than a handful of
white beach randomly scattered.</p>

<p>“The thing’s forbidden, Eustace; it always has
and always will be, I say, and thereby ’tis wrong.”</p>

<p>“Well, if ever I doos anything wrong I allus
feel glad of it next morning.”</p>

<p>“’Tis against law, Eustace, and to be against law is
the downfall of mankind. What I mean to say—I’m
a national man.”</p>

<p>“The law! Foo! That’s made by them as don’t
care for my needs, and don’t understand my rights.
Is it fair to let them control your mind as haven’t got a
grip of their own? I worked for yon farmer a matter
of fourteen years, hard, I tell you, I let my back
sweat....”</p>

<p>The dog at his side was restless; he cuffed it
impatiently: “and twice a week my wife she had to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
go to farmhouse; twice a week; doing up their
washing and their muck—‘Lie down!’” he interjected
sternly to the querulous dog—“two days in
every seven. Then the missus says to my wife, ‘I
shall want you to come four days a week in future,
Mrs. Cocking; the house is too much of a burden
for me.’ My wife says: ‘I can’t come no oftener,
ma’am; I’d not have time to look after my own place,
my husband, and the six children, ma’am.’ Then
missus flew into a passion. ‘Oh, so you won’t come,
eh!’</p>

<p>“‘I’d come if I could, ma’am,’ my wife says, ‘and
gladly, but it ain’t possible, you see.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, very well!’ says the missus. And that
was the end of that, but come Saturday, when the
boss pays me: ‘Cocking,’ he says, ‘I shan’t want
you no more arter next week.’ No explanation, mind
you, and I never asked for none. I know’d what
’twas for, but I don’t give a dam. What meanness,
Mordecai! Of course I don’t give a dam whether I
goes or whether I stops; you know my meaning—I’d
much rather stop; my home’s where I be known; but
I don’t give a dam. ’Tain’t the job I minds so much
as to let him have that power to spite me so at a
moment after fourteen years because of his wife’s
temper. ’Tis not decent. ’Tis under-grading a
man.’”</p>

<p>There was no comment from the shepherd.
Eustace continued: “If that’s your law, Mordecai,
I don’t want it. I ignores it.”</p>

<p>“And that you can’t do,” retorted the old man.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
“God A’mighty can look after the law.”</p>

<p>“If He be willing to take the disgrace of it,
Mordecai Stavely, let Him.”</p>

<p>The men were silent for a long time, until the
younger cheerfully asked: “How be poor old Harry
Mixen?”</p>

<p>“Just alive.”</p>

<p>Eustace leaned back, munching a strig of grass
reflectively and looking at the sky: “Don’t seem no
sign of rain, however?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>The old man who said “No” hung his melancholy
head, and pondered; he surveyed his boots,
which were of harsh hard leather with deep soles.
He then said: “We ought to thank God we had such
mild weather at the back end of the year. If you
remember, it came a beautiful autumn and a softish
winter. Things are growing now; I’ve seen oats
as high as my knee; the clover’s lodged in places.
It will be all good if we escape the east winds—hot
days and frosty nights.”</p>

<p>The downs, huge and bare, stretched in every
direction, green and grey, gentle and steep, their vast
confusion enlightened by a small hanger of beech or
pine, a pond, or more often a derelict barn; for
among the downs there are barns and garners ever
empty, gone into disuse and abandoned. They are
built of flint and red brick, with a roof of tiles. The
rafters often bear an eighteenth-century date. Elsewhere
in this emptiness even a bush will have a
name, and an old stone becomes a track mark. Upon
the soft tufts and among the triumphant furze live a
few despised birds, chats and finches and that blithe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
screamer the lark, but above all, like veins upon the
down’s broad breast, you may perceive the run-way
of the hare.</p>

<p>“Why can’t a man live like a hare?” broke out
the younger man. “I’d not mind being shot at a
time and again. It lives a free life, anyway, not like a
working man with a devil on two legs always cracking
him on.”</p>

<p>“Because,” said Mordecai, “a hare is a vegetarian
creature, what’s called a rubinant, chewing the cud
and dividing not the hoof. And,” he added significantly,
“there be dogs.”</p>

<p>“It takes a mazin’ good dog to catch ever a hare
on its own ground. Most hares could chase any dog
ever born, believe you me, if they liked to try at that.”</p>

<p>“There be traps and wires!”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve no call to rejoice, with the traps set
for a man, and the wires a choking him.”</p>

<p>At that moment two mating hares were roaming
together on the upland just below the men. The
doe, a small fawn creature, crouched coyly before
the other, a large nut-brown hare with dark ears.
Soon she darted away, sweeping before him in a great
circle, or twisting and turning as easily as a snake.
She seemed to fly the faster, but when his muscular
pride was aroused he swooped up to her shoulder,
and, as if in loving derision, leaped over her from
side to side as she ran. She stopped as sharply as
a shot upon its target and faced him, quizzing him
gently with her nose. As they sat thus the dark-eared
one perceived not far off a squatting figure; it
was another hare, a tawny buck, eyeing their dalliance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
The doe commenced to munch the herbage; the
nut-brown one hobbled off to confront this wretched,
rash, intruding fool. When they met both rose upon
their haunches, clawing and scraping and patting at
each other with as little vigour as mild children put
into their quarrels—a rigmarole of slapping hands.
But, notwithstanding the delicacy of the treatment,
the interloper, a meek enough fellow, succumbed,
and the conqueror loped back to his nibbling mistress.</p>

<p>Yet, whenever they rested from their wooing
flights, the tawny interloper was still to be seen near
by. Hapless mourning seemed to involve his
hunched figure; he had the aspect of a deferential,
grovelling man; but the lover saw only his provocative,
envious eye—he swept down upon him.
Standing up again, he slammed and basted him with
puny velvet blows until he had salved his indignation,
satisfied his connubial pride, or perhaps merely some
strange fading instinct—for it seemed but a mock
combat, a ritual to which they conformed.</p>

<p>Away the happy hare would prance to his mate,
but as often as he came round near that shameless
spy he would pounce upon him and beat him to the
full, like a Turk or like a Russian. But though he
could beat him and disgrace him, he could neither
daunt nor injure him. The vanquished miscreant
would remain watching their wooing with the eye of
envy—or perhaps of scorn—and hoping for a miracle
to happen.</p>

<p>And a miracle did happen. Cocking, unseen, near
the beeches released his dog. The doe shot away over
the curve of the hill and was gone. She did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
merely gallop, she seemed to pass into ideal flight,
the shadow of wind itself. Her fawn body, with
half-cocked ears and unperceivable convulsion of the
leaping haunches, soared across the land with the
steady swiftness of a gull. The interloping hare, in a
blast of speed, followed hard upon her traces. But
Cocking’s hound had found at last the hare of its
dreams, a nut-brown, dark-eared, devil-guided,
eluding creature, that fled over the turf of the hill as
lightly as a cloud. The long leaping dog swept in its
track with a stare of passion, following in great curves
the flying thing that grew into one great throb of fear
all in the grand sunlight on the grand bit of a hill.
The lark stayed its little flood of joy and screamed
with notes of pity at the protracted flight; and bloodless
indeed were they who could view it unmoved,
nor feel how sweet a thing is death if you be hound,
how fell a thing it is if you be hare. Too long, O
delaying death, for this little heart of wax; and too
long, O delaying victory, for that pursuer with the
mouth of flame. Suddenly the hound faltered,
staggered a pace or two, then sunk to the grass, its
lips dribbling blood. When Cocking reached him
the dog was dead. He picked the body up.</p>

<p>“It’s against me, like everything else,” he
muttered.</p>

<p>But a voice was calling “Oi! Oi!” He turned to
confront a figure rapidly and menacingly approaching.</p>

<p>“I shall want you, Eustace Cocking,” cried the
gamekeeper, “to come and give an account o’ yourself.”</p>

<h2 id="The_Man_from_Kilsheelan"><i>The Man from Kilsheelan</i></h2>


<p>If you knew the Man from Kilsheelan
it was no use saying you did not believe in
fairies and secret powers; believe it or no, but
believe it you should; there he was. It is true he was
in an asylum for the insane, but he was a man with age
upon him so he didn’t mind; and besides, better men
than himself have been in such places, or they ought
to be, and if there is justice in the world they will be.</p>

<p>“A cousin of mine,” he said to old Tom Tool one
night, “is come from Ameriky. A rich person.”</p>

<p>He lay in the bed next him, but Tom Tool didn’t
answer so he went on again: “In a ship,” he said.</p>

<p>“I hear you,” answered Tom Tool.</p>

<p>“I see his mother with her bosom open once, and
it stuffed with diamonds, bags full.”</p>

<p>Tom Tool kept quiet.</p>

<p>“If,” said the Man from Kilsheelan, “if I’d the
trusty comrade I’d make a break from this and go
seek him.”</p>

<p>“Was he asking you to do that?”</p>

<p>“How could he an’ all and he in a ship?”</p>

<p>“Was he writing fine letters to you then?”</p>

<p>“How could he, under the Lord? Would he give
them to a savage bird or a herring to bring to me so?”</p>

<p>“How did he let on to you?”</p>

<p>“He did not let on,” said the Man from Kilsheelan.</p>

<p>Tom Tool lay long silent in the darkness; he had
a mistrust of the Man, knowing him to have a forgetful
mind; everything slipped through it like rain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
through the nest of a pigeon. But at last he asked
him: “Where is he now?”</p>

<p>“He’ll be at Ballygoveen.”</p>

<p>“You to know that and you with no word from
him?”</p>

<p>“O, I know it, I know; and if I’d a trusty comrade
I’d walk out of this and to him I would go.
Bags of diamonds!”</p>

<p>Then he went to sleep, sudden; but the next night
he was at Tom Tool again: “If I’d a trusty
comrade,” said he; and all that and a lot more.</p>

<p>“’Tis not convenient to me now,” said Tom Tool,
“but to-morrow night I might go wid you.”</p>

<p>The next night was a wild night, and a dark night,
and he would not go to make a break from the
asylum, he said: “Fifty miles of journey, and I with
no heart for great walking feats! It is not convenient,
but to-morrow night I might go wid you.”</p>

<p>The night after that he said: “Ah, whisht wid
your diamonds and all! Why would you go from the
place that is snug and warm into a world that is like
a wall for cold dark, and but the thread of a coat to
divide you from its mighty clasp, and only one thing
blacker under the heaven of God and that’s the road
you walk on, and only one thing more shy than your
heart and that’s your two feet worn to a tissue
tramping in dung and ditches....”</p>

<p>“If I’d a trusty comrade,” said the Man from
Kilsheelan, “I’d go seek my rich cousin.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span></p>
<p>“ ... stars gaping at you a few spans away, and
the things that have life in them, but cannot see or
speak, begin to breathe and bend. If ever your hair
stood up it is then it would be, though you’ve no
more than would thatch a thimble, God help you.”</p>

<p>“Bags of gold he has,” continued the Man, “and
his pockets stuffed with the tobacca.”</p>

<p>“Tobacca!”</p>

<p>“They were large pockets and well stuffed.”</p>

<p>“Do you say, now!”</p>

<p>“And the gold! large bags and rich bags.”</p>

<p>“Well, I might do it to-morrow.”</p>

<p>And the next day Tom Tool and the Man from
Kilsheelan broke from the asylum and crossed the
mountains and went on.</p>

<p>Four little nights and four long days they were
walking; slow it was for they were oldish men and
lost they were, but the journey was kind and the
weather was good weather. On the fourth day Tom
Tool said to him: “The Dear knows what way
you’d be taking me! Blind it seems, and dazed I
am. I could do with a skillet of good soup to steady
me and to soothe me.”</p>

<p>“Hard it is, and hungry it is,” sighed the Man;
“starved daft I am for a taste of nourishment, a
blind man’s dog would pity me. If I see a cat I’ll eat
it; I could bite the nose off a duck.”</p>

<p>They did not converse any more for a time, not
until Tom Tool asked him what was the name of his
grand cousin, and then the Man from Kilsheelan was
in a bedazement, and he was confused.</p>

<p>“I declare, on my soul, I’ve forgot his little name.
Wait now while I think of it.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></p>
<p>“Was it McInerney then?”</p>

<p>“No, not it at all.”</p>

<p>“Kavanagh? the Grogans? or the Duffys?”</p>

<p>“Wait, wait while I think of it now.”</p>

<p>Tom Tool waited; he waited and all until he
thought he would burst.</p>

<p>“Ah, what’s astray wid you? Was it Phelan—or
O’Hara—or Clancy—or Peter Mew?”</p>

<p>“No, not it at all.”</p>

<p>“The Murphys. The Sweeneys. The Moores.”</p>

<p>“Divil a one. Wait while I think of it now.”</p>

<p>And the Man from Kilsheelan sat holding his face
as if it hurt him, and his comrade kept saying at him:
“Duhy, then? Coman? McGrath?” and driving
him distracted with his O this and O that, his Mc
he—s and Mc she—s.</p>

<p>Well, he could not think of it; but when they
walked on they had not far to go, for they came over a
twist of the hills and there was the ocean, and the neat
little town of Ballygoveen in a bay of it below, with
the wreck of a ship lying sunk near the strand. There
was a sharp cliff at either horn of the bay, and between
them some bullocks stravaiging on the beach.</p>

<p>“Truth is a fortune,” cried the Man from Kilsheelan,
“this it is.”</p>

<p>They went down the hill to the strand near the
wreck, and just on the wing of the town they saw a
paddock full of hemp stretched drying, and a house
near it, and a man weaving a rope. He had a great
cast of hemp around his loins, and a green apron.
He walked backwards to the sea, and a young girl
stood turning a little wheel as he went away from her.</p>

<p>“God save you,” said Tom Tool to her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span> “for who
are you weaving this rope?”</p>

<p>“For none but God himself and the hangman,”
said she.</p>

<p>Turning the wheel she was, and the man going
away from it backwards, and the dead wreck in the
rocky bay; a fine sweet girl of good dispose and no
ways drifty.</p>

<p>“Long life to you then, young woman,” says he.
“But that’s a strong word, and a sour word, the Lord
spare us all.”</p>

<p>At that the rope walker let a shout to her to stop
the wheel; then he cut the rope at the end and tied it
to a black post. After that he came throwing off his
green apron and said he was hungry.</p>

<p>“Denis, avick!” cried the girl. “Come, and I’ll
get your food.” And the two of them went away into
the house.</p>

<p>“Brother and sister they are,” said the Man from
Kilsheelan, “a good appetite to them.”</p>

<p>“Very neat she is, and clean she is, and good and
sweet and tidy she is,” said Tom Tool. They stood
in the yard watching some white fowls parading and
feeding and conversing in the grass; scratch, peck,
peck, ruffle, quarrel, scratch, peck, peck, cock a
doodle doo.</p>

<p>“What will we do now, Tom Tool? My belly
has a scroop and a screech in it. I could eat the full of
Isknagahiny Lake and gape for more, or the Hill of
Bawn and not get my enough.”</p>

<p>Beyond them was the paddock with the hemp
drying across it, long heavy strands, and two big
stacks of it beside, dark and sodden, like seaweed.
The girl came to the door and called:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span> “Will ye
take a bite?” They said they would, and that she
should eat with spoons of gold in the heaven of God
and Mary. “You’re welcome,” she said, but no
more she said, for while they ate she was sad and
silent.</p>

<p>The young man Denis let on that their father, one
Horan, was away on his journeys peddling a load of
ropes, a long journey, days he had been gone, and he
might be back to-day, or to-morrow, or the day after.</p>

<p>“A great strew of hemp you have,” said the Man
from Kilsheelan. The young man cast down his
eyes; and the young girl cried out: “’Tis foul hemp,
God preserve us all!”</p>

<p>“Do you tell me of that now,” he asked; but she
would not, and her brother said: “I will tell you.
It’s a great misfortune, mister man. ’Tis from the
wreck in the bay beyant, a good stout ship, but burst
on the rocks one dark terror of a night and all the
poor sailors tipped in the sea. But the tide was low
and they got ashore, ten strong sailor men, with a
bird in a cage that was dead drowned.”</p>

<p>“The Dear rest its soul,” said Tom Tool.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span></p>
<p>“There was no rest in the ocean for a week, the
bay was full of storms, and the vessel burst, and the
big bales split, and the hemp was scattered and torn
and tangled on the rocks, or it did drift. But at last
it soothed, and we gathered it and brought it to the
field here. We brought it, and my father did buy it
of the salvage man for a price; a Mexican valuer he
was, but the deal was bad, and it lies there; going
rotten it is, the rain wears it, and the sun’s astray, and
the wind is gone.”</p>

<p>“That’s a great misfortune. What is on it?”
said the Man from Kilsheelan.</p>

<p>“It is a great misfortune, mister man. Laid out
it is, turned it is, hackled it is, but faith it will not dry
or sweeten, never a hank of it worth a pig’s eye.”</p>

<p>“’Tis the devil and all his injury,” said Kilsheelan.</p>

<p>The young girl, her name it was Christine, sat
grieving. One of her beautiful long hands rested on
her knee, and she kept beating it with the other.
Then she began to speak.</p>

<p>“The captain of that ship lodged in this house with
us while the hemp was recovered and sold; a fine
handsome sport he was, but fond of the drink, and
very friendly with the Mexican man, very hearty they
were, a great greasy man with his hands covered with
rings that you’d not believe. Covered! My father
had been gone travelling a week or a few days when
a dark raging gale came off the bay one night till the
hemp was lifted all over the field.”</p>

<p>“It would have lifted a bullock,” said Denis,
“great lumps of it, like trees.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span></p>
<p>“And we sat waiting the captain, but he didn’t
come home and we went sleeping. But in the
morning the Mexican man was found dead murdered
on the strand below, struck in the skull, and the two
hands of him gone. ’Twas not long when they came
to the house and said he was last seen with the captain,
drunk quarrelling; and where was he? I said
to them that he didn’t come home at all and was away
from it. ‘We’ll take a peep at his bed,’ they said,
and I brought them there, and my heart gave a strong
twist in me when I see’d the captain stretched on it,
snoring to the world and his face and hands smeared
with the blood. So he was brought away and
searched, and in his pocket they found one of the
poor Mexican’s hands, just the one, but none of the
riches. Everything to be so black against him and
the assizes just coming on in Cork! So they took
him there before the judge, and he judged him and
said it’s to hang he was. And if they asked the
captain how he did it, he said he did not do
it at all.”</p>

<p>“But there was a bit of iron pipe beside the body,”
said Denis.</p>

<p>“And if they asked him where was the other hand,
the one with the rings and the mighty jewels on them,
and his budget of riches, he said he knew nothing of
that nor how the one hand got into his pocket.
Placed there it was by some schemer. It was all he
could say, for the drink was on him and nothing he
knew.</p>

<p>“‘You to be so drunk,’ they said, ‘how did you
get home to your bed and nothing heard?’</p>

<p>“‘I don’t know,’ says he. Good sakes, the poor
lamb, a gallant strong sailor he was! His mind was a
blank, he said. ‘’Tis blank,’ said the judge, ‘if it’s
as blank as the head of himself with a gap like that
in it, God rest him!’”</p>

<p>“You could have put a pound of cheese in it,”
said Denis.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span></p>
<p>“And Peter Corcoran cried like a loony man, for
his courage was gone, like a stream of water. To
hang him, the judge said, and to hang him well, was
their intention. It was a pity, the judge said, to rob
a man because he was foreign, and destroy him for
riches and the drink on him. And Peter Corcoran
swore he was innocent of this crime. ‘Put a clean
shirt to me back,’ says he, ‘for it’s to heaven I’m
going.’”</p>

<p>“And,” added Denis, “the peeler at the door said
‘Amen.’”</p>

<p>“That was a week ago,” said Christine, “and in
another he’ll be stretched. A handsome sporting
sailor boy.”</p>

<p>“What ... what did you say was the name of
him?” gasped the Man from Kilsheelan.</p>

<p>“Peter Corcoran, the poor lamb,” said Christine.</p>

<p>“Begod,” he cried out as if he was choking, “’tis
me grand cousin from Ameriky!”</p>

<p>True it was, and the grief on him so great that
Denis was after giving the two of them a lodge till the
execution was over. “Rest here, my dad’s away,”
said he, “and he knowing nothing of the murder, or
the robbery, or the hanging that’s coming, nothing.
Ah, what will we tell him an’ all? ’Tis a black story
on this house.”</p>

<p>“The blessing of God and Mary on you,” said
Tom Tool. “Maybe we could do a hand’s turn for
you; me comrade’s a great wonder with the miracles,
maybe he could do a stroke would free an innocent
man.”</p>

<p>“Is it joking you are?” asked Christine sternly.</p>

<p>“God deliver him, how would I joke on a man
going to his doom and destruction?”</p>

<p>The next day the young girl gave them jobs to do,
but the Man from Kilsheelan was destroyed with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
trouble and he shook like water when a pan of it is
struck.</p>

<p>“What is on you?” said Tom Tool.</p>

<p>“Vexed and waxy I am,” says he, “in regard of the
great journey we’s took, and sorra a help in the end
of it. Why couldn’t he do his bloody murder after
we had done with him?”</p>

<p>“Maybe he didn’t do it at all.”</p>

<p>“Ah, what are you saying now, Tom Tool?
Wouldn’t anyone do it, a nice, easy, innocent crime.
The cranky gossoon to get himself stretched on the
head of it, ’tis the drink destroyed him! Sure’s
there’s no more justice in the world than you’d find
in the craw of a sick pullet. Vexed and waxy I am
for me careless cousin. Do it! Who wouldn’t do
it?”</p>

<p>He went up to the rope that Denis and Christine
were weaving together and he put his finger on it.</p>

<p>“Is that the rope,” says he, “that will hang my
grand cousin?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Denis, “it is not. His rope came
through the post office yesterday. For the prison
master it was, a long new rope—saints preserve us—and
Jimmy Fallon the postman getting roaring drunk
showing it to the scores of creatures would give him
a drink for the sight of it. Just coiled it was, and no
way hidden, with a label on it, ‘O.H.M.S.’”</p>

<p>“The wind’s rising, you,” said Christine. “Take
a couple of forks now, and turn the hemp in the field.
Maybe ’twill scour the Satan out of it.”</p>

<p>“Stormy it does be, and the bay has darkened in
broad noon,” said Tom Tool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

<p>“Why wouldn’t the whole world be dark and a
man to be hung?” said she.</p>

<p>They went to the hemp so knotted and stinking,
and begun raking it and raking it. The wind was
roaring from the bay, the hulk twitching and tottering;
the gulls came off the wave, and Christine’s
clothes stretched out from her like the wings of a
bird. The hemp heaved upon the paddock like a
great beast bursting a snare that was on it, and a
strong blast drove a heap of it upon the Man from
Kilsheelan, twisting and binding him in its clasp till
he thought he would not escape from it and he went
falling and yelping. Tom Tool unwound him, and
sat him in the lew of the stack till he got his
strength again, and then he began to moan of his
misfortune.</p>

<p>“Stint your shouting,” said Tom Tool, “isn’t it
as hard to cure as a wart on the back of a hedgehog?”</p>

<p>But he wouldn’t stint it. “’Tis large and splendid
talk I get from you, Tom Tool, but divil a deed of
strength. Vexed and waxy I am. Why couldn’t he
do his murder after we’d done with him. What a
cranky cousin. What a foolish creature. What a
silly man, the devil take him!”</p>

<p>“Let you be aisy,” the other said, “to heaven he
is going.”</p>

<p>“And what’s the gain of it, he to go with his neck
stretched?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I did know a man went to heaven once,”
began Tom Tool, “but he did not care for it.”</p>

<p>“That’s queer,” said the Man,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span> “for it couldn’t be
anything you’d not want, indeed to glory.”</p>

<p>“Well, he came back to Ireland on the head of it.
I forget what was his name.”</p>

<p>“Was it Corcoran, or Tool, or Horan?”</p>

<p>“No, none of those names. He let on it was a
lonely place, not fit for living people or dead people,
he said; nothing but trees and streams and beasts
and birds.”</p>

<p>“What beasts and birds?”</p>

<p>“Rabbits and badgers, the elephant, the dromedary,
and all those ancient races; eagles and hawks
and cuckoos and magpies. He wandered in a thick
forest for nights and days like a flea in a great beard,
and the beasts and the birds setting traps and hooks
and dangers for a poor feller; the worst villains of all
was the sheep.”</p>

<p>“The sheep! What could a sheep do then?”
asked Kilsheelan.</p>

<p>“I don’t know the right of it, but you’d not believe
me if I told you at all. If you went for the little swim
you was not seen again.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span></p>
<p>“I never heard the like of that in Roscommon.”</p>

<p>“Not another holy soul was in it but himself, and
if he was taken with the thirst he would dip his hand
in a stream that flowed with rich wine and put it to
his lips, but if he did it turned into air at once and
twisted up in a blue cloud. But grand wine to look
at, he said. If he took oranges from a tree he could
not bite them, they were chiny oranges, hard as a
plate. But beautiful oranges to look at they were.
To pick a flower it burst on you like a gun. What
was cold was too cold to touch, and what was warm was
too warm to swallow, you must throw it up, or die.”</p>

<p>“Faith, it’s no region for a Christian soul, Tom
Tool. Where is it at all?”</p>

<p>“High it may be, low it may be, it may be here,
it may be there.”</p>

<p>“What could the like of a sheep do? A
sheep!”</p>

<p>“A devouring savage creature it is there, the most
hard to come at, the most difficult to conquer, with
the teeth of a lion and a tiger, the strength of a bear
and a half, the deceit of two foxes, the run of a deer,
the...”</p>

<p>“Is it heaven you call it! I’d not look twice at a
place the like of that.”</p>

<p>“No, you would not, no.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but wait now,” said Kilsheelan, “wait till
the day of Judgment.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will not wait then,” said Tom Tool
sternly. “When the sinners of the world are called
to their judgment, scatter they will all over the face
of the earth, running like hares till they come to the
sea, and there they will perish.”</p>

<p>“Ah, the love of God on the world!”</p>

<p>They went raking and raking, till they came to a
great stiff hump of it that rolled over, and they could
see sticking from the end of it two boots.</p>

<p>“O, what is it, in the name of God?” asks
Kilsheelan.</p>

<p>“Sorra and all, but I’d not like to look,” says Tom
Tool, and they called the girl to come see what
was it.</p>

<p>“A dead man!” says Christine, in a thin voice
with a great tremble coming on her, and she white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
as a tooth. “Unwind him now.” They began to
unwind him like a tailor with a bale of tweed, and
at last they came to a man black in the face. Strangled
he was. The girl let a great cry out of her. “Queen
of heaven, ’tis my dad; choked he is, the long strands
have choked him, my good pleasant dad!” and she
went with a run to the house crying.</p>

<p>“What has he there in his hand?” asked Kilsheelan.</p>

<p>“’Tis a chopper,” says he.</p>

<p>“Do you see what is on it, Tom Tool?”</p>

<p>“Sure I see, and you see, what is on it; blood is
on it, and murder is on it. Go fetch a peeler, and I’ll
wait while you bring him.”</p>

<p>When his friend was gone for the police Tom Tool
took a little squint around him and slid his hand into
the dead man’s pocket. But if he did he was nearly
struck mad from his senses, for he pulled out a loose
dead hand that had been chopped off as neat as the
foot of a pig. He looked at the dead man’s arms, and
there was a hand to each; so he looked at the hand
again. The fingers were covered with the rings of
gold and diamonds. Covered!</p>

<p>“Glory be to God!” said Tom Tool, and he put
his hand in another pocket and fetched a budget full
of papers and banknotes.</p>

<p>“Glory be to God!” he said again, and put the
hand and the budget back in the pockets, and turned
his back and said prayers until the peelers came and
took them all off to the court.</p>

<p>It was not long, two days or three, until an inquiry
was held; grand it was and its judgment was good.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
And the big-Wig asked: “Where is the man that
found the body?”</p>

<p>“There are two of him,” says the peeler.</p>

<p>“Swear ’em,” says he, and Kilsheelan stepped up
to a great murdering joker of a clerk, who gave him
a book in his hand and roared at him: “I swear by
Almighty God....”</p>

<p>“Yes,” says Kilsheelan.</p>

<p>“Swear it,” says the clerk.</p>

<p>“Indeed I do.”</p>

<p>“You must repeat it,” says the clerk.</p>

<p>“I will, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, repeat it then,” says he.</p>

<p>“And what will I repeat?”</p>

<p>So he told him again and he repeated it. Then the
clerk goes on: “... that the evidence I give....”</p>

<p>“Yes,” says Kilsheelan.</p>

<p>“Say those words, if you please.”</p>

<p>“The words! Och, give me the head of ’em
again!”</p>

<p>So he told him again and he repeated it. Then the
clerk goes on: “ ... shall be the truth....”</p>

<p>“It will,” says Kilsheelan.</p>

<p>“ ... and nothing but the truth....”</p>

<p>“Yes, begod, indeed!”</p>

<p>“Say ‘nothing but the truth,’” roared the clerk.</p>

<p>“No!” says Kilsheelan.</p>

<p>“Say ‘nothing.’”</p>

<p>“All right,” says Kilsheelan.</p>

<p>“Can’t you say ’nothing but the truth'?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he says.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span></p>
<p>“Well, say it!”</p>

<p>“I will, so,” says he, “the scrapings of sense on it
all!”</p>

<p>So they swore them both, and their evidence they
gave.</p>

<p>“Very good,” his lordship said, “a most important
and opportune discovery, in the nick of time, by
the tracing of God. There is a reward of fifty pounds
offered for the finding of this property and jewels:
fifty pounds you will get in due course.”</p>

<p>They said they were obliged to him, though sorrow
a one of them knew what he meant by a due course,
nor where it was.</p>

<p>Then a lawyer man got the rights of the whole
case; he was the cunningest man ever lived in the
city of Cork; no one could match him, and he made
it straight and he made it clear.</p>

<p>Old Horan must have returned from his journey
unbeknown on the night of the gale when the deed
was done. Perhaps he had made a poor profit on his
toil, for there was little of his own coin found on his
body. He saw the two drunks staggering along the
bay—he clove in the head of the one with a bit of
pipe—he hit the other a good whack to still or stiffen
him—he got an axe from the yard—he shore off the
Mexican’s two hands, for the rings were grown
tight and wouldn’t be drawn from his fat fingers.
Perhaps he dragged the captain home to his bed—you
couldn’t be sure of that—but put the hand in the
captain’s pocket he did, and then went to the paddock
to bury the treasure. But a blast of wind whipped
and wove some of the hemp strand around his limbs,
binding him sudden. He was all huffled and hogled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
and went mad with the fear struggling, the hemp
rolling him and binding him till he was strangled or
smothered.</p>

<p>And that is what happened him, believe it or no,
but believe it you should. It was the tracing of God
on him for his dark crime.</p>

<p>Within a week of it Peter Corcoran was away out
of gaol, a stout walking man again, free in Ballygoveen.
But on the day of his release he did not go
near the ropewalker’s house. The Horans were there
waiting, and the two old silly men, but he did not go
next or near them. The next day Kilsheelan said to
her: “Strange it is my cousin not to seek you, and
he a sneezer for gallantry.”</p>

<p>“’Tis no wonder at all,” replied Christine, “and
he with his picture in all the papers.”</p>

<p>“But he had a right to have come now and you
caring him in his black misfortune,” said Tom
Tool.</p>

<p>“Well, he will not come then,” Christine said in
her soft voice, “in regard of the red murder on the
soul of my dad. And why should he put a mark on
his family, and he the captain of a ship.”</p>

<p>In the afternoon Tom Tool and the other went
walking to try if they should see him, and they did
see him at a hotel, but he was hurrying from it; he
had a frieze coat on him and a bag in his hand.</p>

<p>“Well, who are you at all?” asks Peter Corcoran.</p>

<p>“You are my cousin from Ameriky,” says Kilsheelan.</p>

<p>“Is that so? And I never heard it,” says Peter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
“What’s your name?”</p>

<p>The Man from Kilsheelan hung down his old
head and couldn’t answer him, but Tom Tool said:
“Drifty he is, sir, he forgets his little name.”</p>

<p>“Astray is he? My mother said I’ve cousins in
Roscommon, d’ye know ’em? the Twingeings....”</p>

<p>“Twingeing! Owen Twingeing it is!” roared
Kilsheelan. “’Tis my name! ’Tis my name! ’Tis
my name!” and he danced about squawking like a
parrot in a frenzy.</p>

<p>“If it’s Owen Twingeing you are, I’ll bring you to
my mother in Manhattan.” The captain grabbed
up his bag. “Haste now, come along out of it. I’m
going from the cunning town this minute, bad sleep
to it for ever and a month! There’s a cart waiting to
catch me the boat train to Queenstown. Will you
go? Now?”</p>

<p>“Holy God contrive it,” said Kilsheelan; his
voice was wheezy as an old goat, and he made to go
off with him. “Good-day to you, Tom Tool, you’ll
get all the reward and endure a rich life from this
out, fortune on it all, a fortune on it all!”</p>

<p>And the two of them were gone in a twink.</p>

<p>Tom Tool went back to the Horans then; night
was beginning to dusk and to darken. As he went up
the ropewalk Christine came to him from her potato
gardens and gave him signs, he to be quiet and follow
her down to the strand. So he followed her down to
the strand and told her all that happened, till she was
vexed and full of tender words for the old fool.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span></p>
<p>“Aren’t you the spit of misfortune? It would
daunt a saint, so it would, and scrape a tear from silky
Satan’s eye. Those two deluderers, they’ve but the
drainings of half a heart between ’em. And he not
willing to lift the feather of a thought on me? I’d
not forget him till there’s ten days in a week and
every one of ’em lucky. But ... but ... isn’t Peter
Corcoran the nice name for a captain man, the very
pattern?”</p>

<p>She gave him a little bundle into his hands.
“There’s a loaf and a cut of meat. You’d best be
stirring from here.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, and stood looking stupid, for his
mind was in a dream. The rock at one horn of the
bay had a red glow on it like the shawl on the neck
of a lady, but the other was black now. A man was
dragging a turf boat up the beach.</p>

<p>“Listen, you,” said Christine. “There’s two
upstart men in the house now, seeking you and the
other. There’s trouble and damage on the head of it.
From the asylum they are. To the police they have
been, to put an embargo on the reward, and sorra a
sixpence you’ll receive of the fifty pounds of it: to
the expenses of the asylum it must go, they say. The
treachery! Devil and all, the blood sweating on every
coin of it would rot the palm of a nigger. Do you
hear me at all?”</p>

<p>She gave him a little shaking for he was standing
stupid, gazing at the bay which was dying into
grave darkness except for the wash of its broken
waves.</p>

<p>“Do you hear me at all? It’s quit now you should,
my little old man, or they’ll be taking you.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span></p>
<p>“Ah, yes, sure, I hear you, Christine; thank you
kindly. Just looking and listening I was. I’ll be
stirring from it now, and I’ll get on and I’ll go. Just
looking and listening I was, just a wee look.”</p>

<p>“Then good-bye to you, Mr. Tool,” said Christine
Horan, and turning from him she left him in the
darkness and went running up the ropewalk to her
home.</p>

<h2 id="Tribute"><i>Tribute</i></h2>


<p>Two honest young men lived in
Braddle, worked together at the spinning mills at
Braddle, and courted the same girl in the town of
Braddle, a girl named Patience who was poor and
pretty. One of them, Nathan Regent, who wore
cloth uppers to his best boots, was steady, silent, and
dignified, but Tony Vassall, the other, was such a
happy-go-lucky fellow that he soon carried the good
will of Patience in his heart, in his handsome face, in
his pocket at the end of his nickel watch chain, or
wherever the sign of requited love is carried by the
happy lover. The virtue of steadiness, you see, can
be measured only by the years, and this Tony had put
such a hurry into the tender bosom of Patience:
silence may very well be golden, but it is a currency
not easy to negotiate in the kingdom of courtship;
dignity is so much less than simple faith that it is
unable to move even one mountain, it charms the
hearts only of bank managers and bishops.</p>

<p>So Patience married Tony Vassall and Nathan
turned his attention to other things, among them to a
girl who had a neat little fortune—and Nathan
married that.</p>

<p>Braddle is a large gaunt hill covered with dull little
houses, and it has flowing from its side a stream
which feeds a gigantic and beneficent mill. Without
that mill—as everybody in Braddle knew, for it was
there that everybody in Braddle worked—the heart
of Braddle would cease to beat. Tony went on working
at the mill. So did Nathan in a way, but he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
a cute ambitious wife, and what with her money and
influence he was soon made a manager of one of the
departments. Tony went on working at the mill.
In a few more years Nathan’s steadiness so increased
his opportunities that he became joint manager of the
whole works. Then his colleague died; he was
appointed sole manager, and his wealth became so
great that eventually Nathan and Nathan’s wife
bought the entire concern. Tony went on working
at the mill. He now had two sons and a daughter,
Nancy, as well as his wife Patience, so that even his
possessions may be said to have increased although
his position was no different from what it had been
for twenty years.</p>

<p>The Regents, now living just outside Braddle, had
one child, a daughter named Olive, of the same age
as Nancy. She was very beautiful and had been educated
at a school to which she rode on a bicycle until
she was eighteen.</p>

<p>About that time, you must know, the country
embarked upon a disastrous campaign, a war so
calamitous that every sacrifice was demanded of
Braddle. The Braddle mills were worn from their
very bearings by their colossal efforts, increasing by
day or by night, to provide what were called the
sinews of war. Almost everybody in Braddle grew
white and thin and sullen with the strain of constant
labour. Not quite everybody, for the Regents
received such a vast increase of wealth that their eyes
sparkled; they scarcely knew what to do with it;
their faces were neither white nor sullen.</p>

<p>“In times like these,” declared Nathan’s wife,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
“we must help our country still more, still more We
must help; let us lend our money to the country.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Nathan.</p>

<p>So they lent their money to their country. The
country paid them tribute, and therefore, as the
Regent wealth continued to flow in, they helped their
country more and more; they even lent the tribute
back to the country and received yet more tribute for
that.</p>

<p>“In times like these,” said the country, “we must
have more men, more men we must have.” And so
Nathan went and sat upon a Tribunal; for, as everybody
in Braddle knew, if the mills of Braddle ceased
to grind, the heart of Braddle would cease to beat.</p>

<p>“What can we do to help our country?” asked
Tony Vassall of his master, “we have no money to
lend.”</p>

<p>“No?” was the reply. “But you can give your
strong son Dan.”</p>

<p>Tony gave his son Dan to the country.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, dear son,” said his father, and his
brother and his sister Nancy said “Good-bye.” His
mother kissed him.</p>

<p>Dan was killed in battle; his sister Nancy took
his place at the mill.</p>

<p>In a little while the neighbours said to Tony
Vassall: “What a fine strong son is your young
Albert Edward!”</p>

<p>And Tony gave his son Albert Edward to the
country.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, dear son,” said his father; his sister
kissed him, his mother wept on his breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span></p>

<p>Albert Edward was killed in battle; his mother
took his place at the mill.</p>

<p>But the war did not cease; though friend and foe
alike were almost drowned in blood it seemed as
powerful as eternity, and in time Tony Vassall too
went to battle and was killed. The country gave
Patience a widow’s pension, as well as a touching
inducement to marry again; she died of grief.
Many people died in those days, it was not strange
at all. Nathan and his wife got so rich that after the
war they died of over-eating, and their daughter Olive
came into a vast fortune and a Trustee.</p>

<p>The Trustee went on lending the Braddle money
to the country, the country went on sending large
sums of interest to Olive (which was the country’s
tribute to her because of her parents’ unforgotten,
and indeed unforgettable, kindness), while Braddle
went on with its work of enabling the country to do
this. For when the war came to an end the country
told Braddle that those who had not given their lives
must now turn to and really work, work harder than
before the war, much, much harder, or the tribute
could not be paid and the heart of Braddle would
therefore cease to beat. Braddle folk saw that this
was true, only too true, and they did as they were told.</p>

<p>The Vassall girl, Nancy, married a man who had
done deeds of valour in the war. He was a mill hand
like her father, and they had two sons, Daniel and
Albert Edward. Olive married a grand man, though
it is true he was not very grand to look at. He had a
small sharp nose, but they did not matter very much
because when you looked at him in profile his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
bouncing red cheeks quite hid the small sharp nose,
as completely as two hills hide a little barn in a
valley. Olive lived in a grand mansion with numerous
servants who helped her to rear a little family of
one, a girl named Mercy, who also had a small sharp
nose and round red cheeks.</p>

<p>Every year after the survivors’ return from the war
Olive gave a supper to her workpeople and their
families, hundreds of them; for six hours there
would be feasting and toys, music and dancing.
Every year Olive would make a little speech to them
all, reminding them all of their duty to Braddle and
Braddle’s duty to the country, although, indeed, she
did not remind them of the country’s tribute to
Olive. That was perhaps a theme unfitting to touch
upon, it would have been boastful and quite unbecoming.</p>

<p>“These are grave times for our country,” Olive
would declare, year after year: “her responsibilities
are enormous, we must all put our shoulders to the
wheel.”</p>

<p>Every year one of the workmen would make a
little speech in reply, thanking Olive for enabling the
heart of Braddle to continue its beats, calling down
the spiritual blessings of heaven and the golden
blessings of the world upon Olive’s golden head.
One year the honour of replying fell to the husband
of Nancy, and he was more than usually eloquent for
on that very day their two sons had commenced to
doff bobbins at the mill. No one applauded louder
than Nancy’s little Dan or Nancy’s Albert Edward,
unless it was Nancy herself. Olive was always much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
moved on these occasions. She felt that she did not
really know these people, that she would never
know them; she wanted to go on seeing them, being
with them, and living with rapture in their workaday
world. But she did not do this.</p>

<p>“How beautiful it all is!” she would sigh to her
daughter, Mercy, who accompanied her. “I am so
happy. All these dear people are being cared for
by us, just simply us. God’s scheme of creation—you
see—the Almighty—we are his agents—we must
always remember that. It goes on for years, years
upon years it goes on. It will go on, of course, yes,
for ever; the heart of Braddle will not cease to beat.
The old ones die, the young grow old, the children
mature and marry and keep the mill going. When
I am dead ...”</p>

<p>“Mamma, mamma!”</p>

<p>“O yes, indeed, one day! Then <i>you</i> will have to
look after all these things, Mercy, and you will talk
to them—just like me. Yes, to own the mill is a
grave and difficult thing, only those who own them
know how grave and difficult; it calls forth all one’s
deepest and rarest qualities; but it is a divine position,
a noble responsibility. And the people really
love me—I think.”</p>

<h2 id="The_Handsome_Lady"><i>The Handsome Lady</i></h2>


<p>Towards the close of the nineteenth
century the parish of Tull was a genial but
angular hamlet hung out on the north side of a
midland hill, with scarcely renown enough to get
itself marked on a map. Its felicities, whatever they
might be, lay some miles distant from a railway
station, and so were seldom regarded, being neither
boasted of by the inhabitants nor visited by strangers.</p>

<p>But here as elsewhere people were born and, as
unusual, unconspicuously born. John Pettigrove
made a note of them then, and when people came in
their turns to die Pettigrove made a note of that too,
for he was the district registrar. In between whiles,
like fish in a pond, they were immersed in labour until
the Divine Angler hooked them to the bank, and
then, as is the custom, they were conspicuously
buried and laboured presumably no more.</p>

<p>The registrar was perhaps the one person who had
love and praise for the simple place. He was born
and bred in Tull, he had never left Tull, and at forty
years of age was as firmly attached to it as the black
clock to the tower of Tull Church, which never
recorded anything but twenty minutes past four.
His wife Carrie, a delicate woman, was also satisfied
with Tull, but as she owned two or three small pieces
of house property there her fancy may not have been
entirely beyond suspicion; possession, as you might
say, being nine points of the prejudice just as it is of
the law. A year or two after their marriage Carrie
began to suffer from a complication of ailments that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
turned her into a permanent invalid; she was seldom
seen out of the house and under her misfortunes she
peaked and pined, she was troublesome, there was no
pleasing her. If Pettigrove went about unshaven
she was vexed; it was unclean, it was lazy, disgusting;
but when he once appeared with his moustache
shaven off she was exceedingly angry; it was scandalous,
it was shameful, maddening. There is no
pleasing some women—what is a man to do? When
he began to let it grow again and encouraged a beard
she was more tyrannical than ever.</p>

<p>The grey church was small and looked shrunken,
as if it had sagged; it seemed to stoop down upon the
green yard, but the stones and mounds, the cypress
and holly, the strangely faded blue of a door that led
through the churchyard wall to the mansion of the
vicar, were beautiful without pretence, and though as
often as not the parson’s goats used to graze among
the graves and had been known to follow him into
the nave, there was about the ground, the indulgent
dimness under the trees, and the tower with its
unmoving clock, the very delicacy of solitude. It
inspired compassion and not cynicism as, peering as
it were through the glass of antiquity, the stranger
gazed upon its mortal register. In its peace, its
beauty, and its age, all those pious records and hopes
inscribed upon its stones, seemed not uttered in pride
nor all in vain. But to speak truth the church’s grace
was partly the achievement of its lofty situation. A
road climbing up from sloping fields turned abruptly
and traversed the village, sidling up to the church;
there, having apparently satisfied some itch of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
curiosity, it turned abruptly again and trundled back
another way into that northern prospect of farms and
forest that lay in the direction of Whitewater Copse,
Hangman’s Corner, and One O’clock.</p>

<p>It was that prospect which most delighted Pettigrove,
for he was a simple-minded countryman full
of ambling content. Not even the church allured
him so much, for though it pleased him and was
just at his own threshold, he never entered it at all.
Once upon a time there had been talk of him joining
the church choir, for he had a pleasant singing voice,
but he would not go.</p>

<p>“It’s flying in the face of Providence,” cried his
exasperated wife—her mind, too, was a falsetto one:
“You’ve as strong a voice as anyone in Tull, in fact
stronger, not that that is saying much, for Tull air
don’t seem good for songsters if you may judge by
that choir. The air is too thick maybe, I can’t say,
it certainly oppresses my own chest, or perhaps it’s
too thin, I don’t thrive on it myself; but you’ve the
strength and it would do you credit; you’d be a
credit to yourself and it would be a credit to me. But
that won’t move you! I can’t tell what you’d be at;
a drunken man ’ull get sober again, but a fool ...
well, there!”</p>

<p>John, unwilling to be a credit, would mumble an
objection to being tied down to that sort of thing.
That was just like him, no spontaneity, no tidiness in
his mind. Whenever he addressed himself to any
discussion he had, as you might say, to tuck up his
intellectual sleeves, give a hitch to his argumentative
trousers. So he went on singing, just when he had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
mind to it, old country songs, for he disliked what he
called “gimcrack ballads about buzzums and roses.”</p>

<p>Pettigrove’s occupation dealt with the extreme
features of existence, but he himself had no extreme
notions. He was a good medium type of man
mentally and something more than that physically,
but nevertheless he was a disappointment to his wife—he
never gave her any opportunity to shine by his
reflected light. She had nurtured foolish ideas of him
first as a figure of romance, then of some social
importance; he ought to be a parish councillor or
develop eminence somehow in their way of life. But
John was nothing like this, he did not develop, or
shine, or offer counsel, he was just a big, solid, happy
man. There were times when his childless wife
hated every ounce and sign of him, when his fair
clipped beard and hair, which she declared were the
colour of jute, and his stolidity, sickened her.</p>

<p>“I do my duty by him and, please God, I’ll continue
to do it. I’m a humble woman and easily
satisfied. An afflicted woman has no chance, no
chance at all,” she said. After twelve years of
wedded life Pettigrove sometimes vaguely wondered
what it would have been like not to have married
anybody.</p>

<p>One Michaelmas a small house belonging to Mrs.
Pettigrove was let to a widow from Eastbourne.
Mrs. Cronshaw was a fine upstanding woman, gracefully
grave and, as the neighbours said, clean as a
pink. For several evenings after she had taken
possession of the house Pettigrove, who was a very
handy sort of man, worked upon some alterations to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
her garden, and at the end of the third or fourth
evening she had invited him into her bower to sip a
glass of some cordial, and she thanked him for his
labours.</p>

<p>“Not at all, Mrs. Cronshaw.” And he drank
to her very good fortune. Just that and no more.</p>

<p>The next evening she did the same, and the very
next evening to that again. And so it was not long
before they spoke of themselves to each other, turn
and turn about as you might say. She was the widow
of an ironmonger who had died two years before, and
the ironmonger’s very astute brother had given her
an annuity in exchange for her interest in the business.
Without family and with few friends she had been
lonely.</p>

<p>“But Tull is such a hearty place,” she said. “It’s
beautiful. One might forget to be lonely.”</p>

<p>“Be sure of that,” commented Pettigrove. They
had the light of two candles and a blazing fire. She
grew kind and more communicative to him; a
strangely, disturbingly attractive woman, dark, with
an abundance of well-dressed hair and a figure of
charm. She had carpet all over her floor; nobody
else in Tull dreamed of such a thing. She did not
cover her old dark table with a cloth as everybody
else habitually did. The pictures on the wall were
real, and the black-lined sofa had cushions on it of
violet silk which she sometimes actually sat upon.
There was a dainty dresser with china and things, a
bureau, and a tall clock that told the exact time. But
there was no music, music made her melancholy.
In Pettigrove’s home there were things like these but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
they were not the same. His bureau was jammed in a
corner with flowerpots upon its top; his pictures
comprised two photo prints of a public park in
Swansea—his wife had bought them at an auction
sale. Their dresser was a cumbersome thing with
knobs and hooks and jars and bottles, and the tall
clock never chimed the hours. The very armchairs
at Mrs. Cronshaw’s were wells of such solid
comfort that it made him feel uncomfortable to use
them.</p>

<p>“Ah, I should like to be sure of it!” she continued.
“I have not found kindly people in the
cities—they do not even seem to notice a fine day!—I
have not found them anywhere, so why should they
be in Tull? You are a wise man, tell me, is Tull the
exception?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mrs. Cronshaw. You must come and visit
us whenever you’ve a mind to; have no fear of
loneliness.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will come and visit you,” she declared,
“soon, I will.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, you must visit us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, soon, I must.”</p>

<p>But weeks passed over and the widow did not keep
her promise although she only lived a furlong from
his door. Pettigrove made no further invitation for
he found excuses on many evenings to visit her. It
was easy to see that she did not care for his wife,
and he did not mind this for neither did he care for
her now. The old wish that he had never been married
crept back into his mind, a sly, unsavoury visitant;
it was complicated by a thought that his wife might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
not live long, a dark, shameful thought that nevertheless
trembled into hope. So on many of the long
winter evenings, while his wife dozed in her bed, he
sat in the widow’s room talking of things that were
strange and agreeable. She could neither understand
nor quite forgive his parochialism; this was sweet
flattery to him. He had scarcely ever set foot outside
a ten-mile radius of Tull, but he was an intelligent
man, and all her discourse was of things he could
perfectly understand! For the first time in his life
Pettigrove found himself lamenting the dullness of
existence. He tried to suppress this tendency, but
words would come and he was distressed. He had
always been in love with things that lasted, that had
stability, that gave him a recognition and guidance,
but now his feelings were flickering like grass in a gale.</p>

<p>“How strange that is,” she said, when he told
her this, “we seem to have exchanged our feelings.
I am happy here, but I know that dark thought, yes,
that life is a dull journey on which the mind searches
for variety, unvarying variety.”</p>

<p>“But what for?” he cried.</p>

<p>“It is constantly seeking change.”</p>

<p>“But for why? It seems like treachery to life.”</p>

<p>“It may be so, but if you seek, you find.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Whatever you are seeking.”</p>

<p>“What am I seeking?”</p>

<p>“Not to know that is the blackest treachery to life.
We are growing old,” she added inconsequently,
stretching her hands to the fire. She wore black silk
mittens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps that’s it,” he allowed, with a laugh.
“Childhood’s best.”</p>

<p>“Surely not,” she protested.</p>

<p>“Ah, but I was gay enough then. I’m not a
religious man, you know—and perhaps that’s the
reason—but however—I can remember things of
great joy and pleasure then.”</p>

<p>And it seemed from his recollections that not the
least pleasant and persistent was his memory of the
chapel, a Baptist hall long since closed and decayed,
to which his mother had sent him on Sunday afternoons.
It was a plain, tough, little tabernacle, with
benches of deal, plain deal, very hard, covered with a
clear varnish that smelled pleasant. The platform
and its railing, the teacher’s desk, the pulpit were all
of deal, the plainest deal, very hard and all covered
with the clear varnish that smelled very pleasant.
And somehow the creed and the teacher and the
attendants were like that too, all plain and hard,
covered with a varnish that was pleasant. But there
was a way in which the afternoon sun beamed through
the cheap windows that lit up for young Pettigrove
an everlasting light. There were hymns with tunes
that he hoped would be sung in Paradise. The texts,
the stories, the admonitions of the teachers, were
vivid and evidently beautiful in his memory. Best
of all was the privilege of borrowing a book at the
end of school time—<i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i> or <i>Uncle Tom’s
Cabin</i>.</p>

<p>For a While his recollections restored him to cheerfulness,
but his dullness soon overcame him again.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span></p>
<p>“I have been content all my life. Never was a
man more content. And now! It’s treachery if
you like. My faith’s gone, content gone, for
why?”</p>

<p>He rose to go, and as he paused at the door to bid
her good-night she took his hand and softly and
tenderly said: “Why are you depressed? Don’t
be so. Life is not dull, it is only momentarily
unkind.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I’ll get used to it.”</p>

<p>“John Pettigrove, you must never get used to
dullness, I forbid you.”</p>

<p>“But I thought Tull was beautiful,” he said as he
paused upon the doorsill. “I thought Tull was
beautiful....”</p>

<p>“Until I came?” It was so softly uttered and
she closed the door so quickly upon him. They
called “Good-night, good-night” to each other
through the door.</p>

<p>He went away through the village, his mind streaming
with strange emotions. He exulted, and yet he
feared for himself and for the widow, but he could not
summon from the depths of his mind what it was he
feared. He passed a woman in the darkness who,
perhaps mistaking him for another, said “Good-night,
my love.”</p>

<p>The next morning he sat in the kitchen after breakfast.
It wanted but a few days to Christmas. There
was no frost in the air; the wind roared, but the day,
though grey, was not gloomy; only the man was
gloomy.</p>

<p>“Nothing ever happens,” he murmured.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span> “True,
but what would you want to happen?”</p>

<p>Out in the scullery a village girl was washing
dishes; as she rattled the ware she hummed a song.
From his back window Pettigrove could see a barn
in a field, two broken gates, a pile of logs, faggots, and
a single pollarded willow whose head was strangled
under a hat of ivy. Beside a barley stack was a goose
with a crooked neck; it stood sulking. High aloft
in the sky thousands of blown rooks wrangled like
lost men. And Pettigrove vowed he would go no
more to the widow—not for a while. Something
inside him kept asking, Why not? And he as quickly
replied to himself: “You know, you know. You’ll
find it all in God-a-mighty’s own commandments.
Stick to them, you can’t do more—at least, you
might, but what would be the good?”</p>

<p>So that evening he went along to the Christmas
lottery held in a vast barn, dimly lit and smelling of
vermin. A rope hung over each of its two giant
beams, dangling smoky lanterns. There was a crowd
of men and boys inspecting the prizes in the gloomy
corners, a pig sulking in a pen of hurdles, sacks of
wheat, live hens in coops, a row of dead hares hung
on the rail of a wagon. Amid silence a man plunged
his hand into a corn measure and drew forth a
numbered ticket; another man drew from a similar
measure a blank ticket or a prize ticket. Each time
a prize was drawn a hum of interest spread through
the onlookers, but when the chief prize, the fat pig,
was drawn against number seventy-nine there was
agitation, excitement even.</p>

<p>“Who be it?” cried several.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span> “Who be number
seventy-nine for the fat pig?”</p>

<p>A man consulted a list and said doubtfully: “Miss
Subey Jones—who be she?”</p>

<p>No one seemed to know until a husky alto voice
from a corner piped: “I know her. She’s from
Shottsford way, over by Squire Marchand’s.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” murmured the disappointed men; the
husky voice continued: “Day afore yesterday she
hung herself.”</p>

<p>For a few seconds there was a pained silence, until
a powerful voice cried: “It’s a mortal shame, chaps.”</p>

<p>The ceremony proceeded until all the tickets were
drawn and all the prizes won and distributed. The
cackling hens were seized from the pens by their
legs and handed upside down to their new owners.
The pig was bundled squealing into a sack. Bags of
wheat were shouldered and the white-bellied hares
were held up to the light. Everybody was animated
and chattered loudly.</p>

<p>“I had number thirty in the big chance and I won
nothing. And I had number thirty-one in the little
chance and I won a duck. Number thirty-one was
my number, and number thirty in the big draw; I
won nothing in that, but in the little draw I won a
duck. Well, there’s flesh for you.”</p>

<p>Some of those who had won hens held them out
to a white-faced youth who smoked a large rank pipe;
he took each fowl quietly by the neck and twisted it
till it died. A few small feathers stuck to his hands
or wavered to the floor, and even after the bird was
dead and carried away it continued slowly and vaguely
to flap its big wings and scatter its lorn feathers.</p>

<p>Pettigrove spent most of the next day in the forest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
plantation south of Tull Great Wood, where a few
chain of soil had been cultivated and reserved for
seedlings, trees of larch and pine no bigger than
potted geraniums, groves of oaks with stems slender
as a cockerel’s leg and most of the stiff brown leaves
still clinging to the famished twigs; or sycamores,
thin but tall, flourishing in a mat of their own dropped
foliage that was the colour of butter fringed with
blood and stained with black gouts like a child’s
copy-book. It was a toy forest, dense enough for the
lair of a beast, and dim enough for an anchorite’s
meditations, but a dog could leap over it, and a boy
could stand amid its growth and look like Gulliver in
Lilliput.</p>

<p>“May I go into the wood?” a voice called to
Pettigrove. Looking sharply up he saw Mrs. Cronshaw,
clad in a long dark blue cloak with a fur necklet,
a grey velvet hat trimmed with a pigeon’s wing
confining her luxuriant hair.</p>

<p>“Ah, you may,” he said, stalking to her side, “but
you’d best not, ’tis a heavy marshy soil within and the
ways are stabbled by the hunters’ horses. Better
keep out till summer comes, then ’tis dry and
pleasant-like.”</p>

<p>She sat down awkwardly on a heap of faggots, her
feet turned slightly inwards, but her cheeks were
dainty pink in the cold air. What a smart lady!
He stood telling her things about the wood, its birds
and foxes; deep in the heart of it all was a lovely
open space covered with the greenest grass and a
hawthorn tree in the middle of that. It bloomed in
spring with heavy creamy blossom. No, he had never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
seen any fairies there. Come to that, he did not
expect to, he had never thought of it.</p>

<p>“But there are fairies, you know,” cried the
widow. “O yes, in old times, I mean very old times,
before the Romans, in fact before Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob then, the Mother of the earth had a big
family, thousands, something like the old woman who
lived in a shoe she was. And one day God sent word
to say he was coming to visit her. Well, then! She
was so excited—the Mother of the earth—that she
made a great to do you may be sure, and after she
had made her house sparkle with cleanliness and had
baked a great big pie she began to wash her children.
All of a sudden she heard the trumpets blow—God
was just a-coming! So as she hadn’t got time to
finish them all, she hid those unwashed ones away
out of sight, and bade them to remain there and make
no noise or she would be angry and punish them.
But you can’t conceal anything from the King of All
and He knew of those hidden children, and he caused
them to be hidden from mortal eyes for ever, and
they are the fairies, O yes!”</p>

<p>“No, nothing can be concealed,” Pettigrove
admitted in his slow grave fashion, “murder will out,
as they say, but that’s a tough morsel if you’re going
to swallow it all.”</p>

<p>“But I like to believe in those things I Wish were
true.”</p>

<p>“Ah, so, yes,” said Pettigrove.</p>

<p>It was an afternoon of damp squally blusters,
uncheering, with slaty sky; the air itself seemed
slaty, and though it had every opportunity and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
invitation to fall, the rain, with strange perversity,
held off. In the oddest corners of the sky, north and
east, a miraculous glow could be seen, as if the sun in a
moment of aberration had determined to set just then
and just there. The wind made a long noise in the
sky, the smell of earth rose about them, of timber and
of dead leaves; except for rooks, or a wren cockering
itself in a bush, no birds were to be seen.</p>

<p>Letting his spade fall Pettigrove sat down beside
the widow and kissed her. She blushed red as a
cherry and he got up quickly.</p>

<p>“I ought not to ha’ done it, I ought not to ha’
done that, Mrs. Cronshaw!”</p>

<p>“Caroline!” said she, smiling the correction at him.</p>

<p>“Is that your name?” He sat down by her
again. “Why, it is the same as my wife’s.”</p>

<p>And Caroline said “Humph! You’re a strange
man, but you are wise and good. Tell me, does she
understand you?”</p>

<p>“What is there to understand? We are wed and
we are faithful to each other, I can take my oath on
that to God or man.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, but what is faith—without love
between you? You see? You have long since
broken your vows to love and cherish, understand
that, you have broken them in half.”</p>

<p>She had picked up a stick and was drawing
patterns of cubes and stars in the soil.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span></p>
<p>“But what is to be done, Caroline? Life is good,
but there is good living and there is bad living, there
is fire and there is water. It is strange what the
Almighty permits to happen.”</p>

<p>A slow-speaking man; scrupulous of thought and
speech he weighed each idea before its delivery as
carefully as a tobacconist weighs an ounce of tobacco.</p>

<p>“Have some cake?” said Caroline, drawing a
package from a pocket. “Will you have a piece ...
John?”</p>

<p>She seemed to be on the point of laughing aloud
at him. He took the fragment of cake but he did not
eat it as she did. He held it between finger and
thumb and stared at it.</p>

<p>“It’s strange how a man let’s his tongue wag now
and again as if he’d got the universe stuck on the end
of a common fork.”</p>

<p>“Or at the end of a knitting needle, yes, I know,”
laughed Caroline, brushing the crumbs from her
lap. Then she bent her head, patted her lips, and
regurgitated with a gesture of apology—just like a
lady. “But what are you saying? If there is love
between you there is faithfulness, if there is no love
there is no fidelity.”</p>

<p>He bit a mouthful off the cake at last.</p>

<p>“Maybe true, but you must have respect for the
beliefs of others....”</p>

<p>“How can you if they don’t fit in with your own?”</p>

<p>“Or there is sorrow.” He bolted the rest of his
cake. “O you are right, I daresay, Caroline, no
doubt; it’s right, I know, but is it reasonable?”</p>

<p>“There are afflictions,” she said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span> “which time
will cure, so they don’t matter; but there are others
which time only aggravates, so what can we do?
I daresay it’s different with a man, but a woman, you
know, grasps at what she wants. That sounds
reasonable, but you don’t think it’s right?”</p>

<p>In the cold whistling sky a patch of sunset had now
begun to settle in its proper quarter, but as frigid and
unconvincing as a stage fireplace. Pettigrove sat
with his great hands clasped between his knees.
Perhaps she grew tired of watching the back of him;
she rose to go, but she said gently enough: “Come
in to-night, I want to tell you something.”</p>

<p>“I will, Caroline.”</p>

<p>Later, when he reached home, he found two little
nieces had arrived, children of some relatives who
lived a dozen miles away. A passing farmer had
dropped them at Tull; their parents were coming a
day later to spend Christmas with the Pettigroves.</p>

<p>They sat up in his wife’s room after tea, for Carrie
left her bed only for an hour or two at noon. She
dozed against her pillows, a brown shawl covering
her shoulders, while the two children played by the
hearth. Pettigrove sat silent, gazing in the fire.</p>

<p>“What a racket you are making, Polly and Jane!”
quavered Carrie.</p>

<p>The little girls thereupon ceased their sporting and
took a picture book to the hearthrug where they
examined it in awed silence by the firelight. After
some minutes the invalid called out: “Don’t make
such a noise turning over all them leaves.”</p>

<p>Polly made a grimace and little Jane said: “We
are looking at the pictures.”</p>

<p>“Well,” snapped Mrs. Pettigrove, “why can’t
you keep to the one page!”</p>

<p>John sat by the fire vowing to himself that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
would not go along to the widow, and in the very act
of vowing he got up and began putting on his
coat.</p>

<p>“Are you going out, John?”</p>

<p>“There’s a window catch to put right along at
Mrs. Cronshaw’s,” he said. At other times it had
been a pump to mend, a door latch to adjust, or a
jamb to ease.</p>

<p>“I never knew things to go like it before—I can’t
understand it,” his wife commented. “What with
windows and doors and pumps and bannisters anyone
would think the house had got the rot. It’s done
for the purpose, or my name’s not what it is.”</p>

<p>“It won’t take long,” he said as he went.</p>

<p>The wind had fallen away, but the sky, though
clearer, had a dull opaque mean appearance, and the
risen moon, without glow, without refulgence, was
like a brass-headed nail stuck in a kitchen wall.</p>

<p>The yellow blind at the widow’s cot was drawn
down and the candles within cast upon the blind
a slanting image of the birdcage hanging at the
window; a fat dapper bird appeared to be snoozing
upon its rod; a tiny square was probably a lump of
sugar; the glass well must have been half full of
water, it glistened and twinkled on the blind. The
shadowy bird shifted one foot, then the other, and
just opened its beak as Pettigrove tapped at the door.</p>

<p>They did not converse very easily, there was
constraint between them, Pettigrove’s simple mind
had a twinge of guilt.</p>

<p>“Will you take lime juice or cocoa?” asked the
widow, and he said:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span> “Cocoa.”</p>

<p>“Little or large?”</p>

<p>And he said: “Large.”</p>

<p>While they sat sipping the cocoa Caroline began:
“Well, I am going away, you know. No, not for
good, just a short while, for Christmas only, or
very little longer. I must go.”</p>

<p>She nestled her blue shawl more snugly round her
shoulders. A cough seemed to trouble her. “There
are things you can’t put on one side for ever....”</p>

<p>“Even if they don’t fit in with your own ideas!”
he said slyly.</p>

<p>“Yes, even then.”</p>

<p>He put down his cup and took both her hands in
his own. “How long?”</p>

<p>“Not long, not very long, not long enough....”</p>

<p>“Enough for what?” He broke up her hesitation.
“For me to forget you? No, no, not in the
fifty-two weeks of the whole world of time.”</p>

<p>“I did want to stay here,” she said, “and see all
the funny things country people do now.” She was
rather vague about those funny things. “Carols,
mumming, visiting; go to church on Christmas
morning, though how I should get past those dreadful
goats, I don’t know; why are they always in the
churchyard?”</p>

<p>“Teasy creatures they are! Followed parson into
service one Sunday, indeed, ah! one of ’em did.
Jumped up in his pulpit, too, so ’tis said. But when
are you coming back?”</p>

<p>She told him it was a little uncertain, she was not
sure, she could not say, it was a little uncertain.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span></p>
<p>“In a week, maybe?”</p>

<p>Yes, a week; but perhaps it would be longer, she
could not say, it was uncertain.</p>

<p>“So. Well, all right then, I shall watch for you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, watch for me.”</p>

<p>They gave each other good wishes and said good-bye
in the little dark porch. The shadowy bird on
the blind stood up and shrugged itself. Pettigrove’s
stay had scarcely lasted an hour, but in that time the
moon had gone, the sky had cleared, and in its
ravishing darkness the stars almost crackled, so
fierce was their mysterious perturbation. The
village man felt Caroline’s arms about him and her
lips against his mouth as she whispered a “God bless
you.” He turned away home, dazed, entranced, he
did not heed the stars. In the darkness a knacker’s
cart trotted past him with a dim lantern swinging at
its tail and the driver bawling a song. In the keen
air the odour from the dead horse sickened him.</p>

<p>Pettigrove passed Christmas gaily enough with his
kindred, and even his wife indulged in brief gaieties.
Her cousin was one of those men full of affable
disagreements; an attitude rather than an activity of
mind. He had a curious face resembling an owl’s
except in its colour (which was pink) and in its tiny
black moustache curling downwards like a dark ring
under his nose. If Pettigrove remarked upon a fine
sunset the cousin scoffed, scoffed benignantly; there
was a sunset every day, wasn’t there?—common as
grass, weren’t they? As for the farming hereabouts,
nothing particular in it was there? The scenery was,
well, it was just scenery, a few hills, a few woods,
plenty of grass fields. No special suitability of soil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
for any crop; corn would be just average, wasn’t that
so? And the roots, well, on his farm at home he
could show mangolds as big as young porkers, forty
to the cartload, or thereabouts. There weren’t no
farmers round here making a fortune, he’d be bound,
and as for their birds, he should think they lived on
rook pie.</p>

<p>Pettigrove submitted that none of the Tull farmers
looked much the worse for farming.</p>

<p>“Well, come,” said the other, “I hear your workhouses
be middling full. Now an old neighbour of
mine, old Frank Stinsgrove, was a man as <i>could</i> farm,
any mortal thing. He wouldn’t have looked at this
land, not at a crown an acre, and he was a man as
<i>could</i> farm, any mortal thing, oranges and lemons if
he’d a mind to it. What a head that man had, God
bless, his brain was stuffed! Full!! He’d declare
black was white, and what’s more he could prove it.
I like a man like that.”</p>

<p>The cousin’s wife was a vast woman, shaped like a
cottage loaf. For some reason she clung to her stays:
it could not be to disguise or curb her bulk, for they
merely put a gloss upon it. You could only view
her as a dimension, think of her as a circumference,
and wonder grimly what she looked like when she
prepared for the bath. She devoured turkey and pig
griskin with such audible voracity that her husband
declared that he would soon be compelled to wear
corks in his earholes at meal times, yes, the same as
they did in the artillery. She was quite unperturbed
by this even when little Jane giggled, and she
avowed that good food was a great enjoyment to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span></p>

<p>“O ’tis a good thing and a grand thing, but take
that child now,” said her father. Resting his elbow
on the table he indicated with his fork the diminutive
Jane; upon the fork hung a portion of meat large
enough to half-sole a lady’s shoe. “She’s just the
reverse, she eats as soft as a fly, a spillikin a day, and
not a mite more; no, very dainty is our Jane.”
Here he swallowed the meat and treated four promising
potatoes with very great savagery. “Do you
know our Jane is going to marry a house-painter,
yah, a house-painter, or is it a coach-painter? ’Tis
smooth and gentle work, she says, not like rough
farmers or chaps that knock things pretty hard,
smiths and carpenters, you know. O Lord! eight
years old, would you believe it? The spillikin!
John, this griskin’s a lovely bit of meat.”</p>

<p>“Beautiful meat,” chanted his wife, “like a pig
we killed a month ago. That was a nice pig, fat and
contented as you’d find any pig, ’twould have been a
shame to keep him alive any longer. It dressed so
well, a picture it was, the kidneys shun like gold.”</p>

<p>“That reminds me of poor old Frank Stinsgrove,”
said her husband. “He’d a mint of money, a very
wealthy man, but he didn’t like parting with it.
He’d got oldish and afraid of his death, must have a
doctor calling to examine him every so often. Didn’t
mind spending a fortune on doctors, but every other
way he’d skin a flint. And there was nought wrong
with him, ’cept age. So his daughter ups and says
to him one day—You are wasting your money on all
these doctors, father, they do you no good, what you
must have is nice, dainty, nourishing food. Now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
what about some of these new laid eggs? How
much are they fetching now? old Frank says. A
penny farthing, says she. A penny farthing! I
cannot afford it. And there was that man with a
mint of money, a mint, could have bought Buckingham
Palace—you understand me—and yet he must
go on with his porridge and his mustard plasters and
his syrup of squills, until at last a smartish doctor
really did find something the matter with him, in his
kidneys. They operated, mark you, and they say—but
I never quite had the rights of it—they say they
gave him a new kidney made of wax; a new wax
kidney, ah, and I believe it was successful, only he
had not to get himself into any kind of a heat, of
course, nor sit too close to the fire. ’Stonishing what
they doctors can do with your innards. But of course
he was too old, soon died. Left a fortune, a mint of
money, could have bought the crown of England.
Staunch old chap, you know.”</p>

<p>Throughout the holidays John sang his customary
ballads, “The Bicester Ram,” “The Unquiet
Grave,” and dozens of others. After songs there
would be things to eat. Then a game of cards, and
after that things to eat. Then a walk to the inn, to
the church, to a farm, or to a friend’s where, in all
jollity, there would be things to eat and drink. They
went to a meet of the hounds, a most successful
outing for it gave them ravening appetites. In short,
as the cousin’s wife said when bidding farewell, it was
a time of great enjoyment.</p>

<p>And Pettigrove said so too. He believed it, and
yet was glad to be quit of his friends in order to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
contemplate the serene dawn that was to come at any
hour now. By New Year’s Day Mrs. Cronshaw had
not returned, but the big countryman was patient,
his mind, though not at rest, was confident. The
days passed as invisibly as warriors in a hostile
country, and almost before he had begun to despair
February came, a haggard month to follow a frosty
January. Mist clung to the earth as tightly as the
dense grey fur on the back of a cat, ice began to
uncongeal, adjacent lands became indistinct, and
distant fields could not be seen at all. The banks of
the roads and the squat hedges were heavily dewed.
The cries of invisible rooks, the bleat of unseen sheep,
made yet more gloomy the contours of motionless
trees wherefrom the slightest movement of a bird
fetched a splatter of drops to the road, cold and uncheering.</p>

<p>All this inclemency crowded into the heart of the
waiting man, a distress without a gleam of anger or
doubt, but only a fond anxiety. Other anxieties
came upon him which, without lessening his melancholy,
somewhat diverted it: his wife suffered a
sudden grave decline in health, and on calling in the
doctor Pettigrove was made aware of her approaching
end. Torn between a strange recovered fondness for
his sinking wife and the romantic adventure with the
widow, which, to his mind at such a juncture, wore
the sourest aspect of infidelity, Pettigrove dwelt in
remorse and grief until the night of St. Valentine’s
Day, when he received a letter. It came from a coast
town in Norfolk, from a hospital; Caroline, too, was
ill. She made light of her illness, but it was clear to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
him now that this and this alone was the urgent
reason of her retreat from Tull at Christmas. It was
old tubercular trouble (that was consumption, wasn’t
it?) which had driven her into sanatoriums on several
occasions in recent years. She was getting better
now, she wrote, but it would be months before she
would be allowed to return. It had been rather a bad
attack, so sudden. Now she had no other thought or
desire in the world but to be back at Tull with her
friend, and in time to see that fairy may tree at bloom
in the wood—he had promised to show it to her—they
would often go together, wouldn’t they—and she
signed herself his, “with the deepest affection.”</p>

<p>He did not remember any promise to show her the
tree, but he sat down straightway and wrote her a
letter of love, incoherently disclosed and obscurely
worded for any eyes but hers. He did not mention
his wife; he had suddenly forgotten her. He sealed
the letter and put it aside to be posted on the morrow.
Then he crept back to his wife’s room and continued
his sick vigil.</p>

<p>But in that dim room, lit by one small candle, he
did not heed the invalid. His mind, feverishly alert,
was devoted to thoughts of that other who also lay
sick, and who had intimidated him. He had feared
her, feared for himself. He had behaved like a lost
wanderer who at night, deep in a forest, had come
upon the embers of a fire left mysteriously glowing,
and had crept up to it frightened, without stick or
stone: if only he had conquered his fear he might
have lain down and rested by its strange comfort.
But now he was sure of her love, sure of his own, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
was secure, he would lay down and rest. She would
come with all the sweetness of her passion and the
valour of her frailty, stretching smooth, quiet wings
over his lost soul.</p>

<p>Then he began to be aware of a soft, insistent
noise, tapping, tapping, tapping, that seemed to come
from the front door below. To assure himself he
listened intently, and soon it became almost the only
sound in the world, clear but soft, sharp and thin, as
if struck with the finger nails only, tap, tap, tap,
quickly on the door. When the noise ceased he got
up and groped stealthily down his narrow crooked
staircase. At the bottom he waited in an uncanny
pause until just beyond him he heard the gentle
urgency again, tap, tap, and he flung open the door.
There was enough gloomy light to reveal the emptiness
of the porch; there was nothing there, nothing
to be seen, but he could distinctly hear the sound of
feet being vigorously shuffled on the doormat below
him, as if the shoes of some light-foot visitor were
being carefully cleaned before entry. Then it
stopped. Beyond that—nothing. Pettigrove was
afraid, he dared not cross the startling threshold, he
shot back the door, bolted it in a fluster, and blundered
away up the stairs.</p>

<p>And there was now darkness, the candle in his
wife’s room having spent itself, but as a glow from
the fire embers remained he did not hasten to light
another candle. Instead, he fastened the bedroom
door also, and stood filled with wondering uneasiness,
dreading to hear the tap, tap, tap come again, just
there, behind him. He listened for it with stopped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
breath, but he could hear nothing, not the faintest
scruple of sound, not the beat of his own heart, not a
flutter from the fire, not a rustle of feet, not a breath—no!
not even a breathing! He rushed to the bed and
struck a match: that was a dead face.... Under the
violence of his sharpening shock he sank upon the
bed beside dead Carrie and a faint crepuscular agony
began to gleam over the pensive darkness of his
mind, with a promise of mad moonlight to follow.</p>

<p>Two days later a stranger came to the Pettigrove’s
door, a short brusque, sharp-talking man with iron-grey
hair and iron-rimmed spectacles. He was an
ironmonger.</p>

<p>“Mr. Pettigrove? My name is Cronshaw, of
Eastbourne, rather painful errand, my sister-in-law,
Mrs. Cronshaw, tenant of yours, I believe.”</p>

<p>Pettigrove stiffened into antagonism: what the
devil was all this? “Come in,” he remarked grimly.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Cronshaw, following Pettigrove
into the parlour where, with many sighs and
much circumstance, he doffed his overcoat and stood
his umbrella in a corner. “Had to walk from the
station, no conveyances; that’s pretty stiff, miles and
miles.”</p>

<p>“Have a drop of wine?” invited Pettigrove.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the visitor.</p>

<p>“It’s dandelion.”</p>

<p>“Very kind of you, I’m sure.” Cronshaw drew
a chair up to the fireplace, though the fire had not
been lit, and the grate was full of ashes, and asked if
he might smoke. Pettigrove did not mind; he
poured out a glass of the yellow wine while Cronshaw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
lit his pipe. The room smelled stuffy, heavy noises
came from overhead as if men were moving furniture.
The stranger swallowed a few drops of the wine,
coughed, and said: “My sister-in-law is dead, I’m
sorry to say. You had not heard, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Dead!” whispered Pettigrove. “Mrs. Cronshaw!
No, no, I had not, I had not heard that, I did
not know. Mrs. Cronshaw dead—is it true?”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the stranger with a laboured sigh.
“Two nights ago in a hospital at Mundesley. I’ve
just come on from there. It was very sudden, O,
frightfully sudden, but it was not unexpected, poor
woman, it’s been off and on with her for years. She
was very much attached to this village, I suppose, and
we’re going to bury her here, it was her last request.
That’s what I want to do now. I want to arrange
about the burial and the disposal of her things and to
give up possession of your house. I’m very sorry
for that.”</p>

<p>“I’m uncommon grieved to hear this,” said
Pettigrove. “She was a handsome lady.”</p>

<p>“O yes,” the ironmonger took out his pocket-book
and prepared to write in it.</p>

<p>“A handsome lady,” continued the countryman
tremulously, “handsome, handsome.”</p>

<p>At that moment someone came heavily down the
stairs and knocked at the parlour door.</p>

<p>“Come in,” cried Pettigrove. A man with red
face and white hair shuffled into the room; he was
dressed in a black suit that had been made for a
man not only bigger, but probably different in other
ways.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span></p>

<p>“We shall have to shift her down here now,” he
began. “I was sure we should, the coffin’s too big
to get round that awkward crook in these stairs when
it’s loaded. In fact, ’tis impossible. Better have her
down now afore we put her in, or there’ll be an accident
on the day as sure as judgment.” The man,
then noticing Cronshaw, said: “Good-morning, sir,
you’ll excuse me.”</p>

<p>The ironmonger stared at him with horror, and
then put his notebook away.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, then,” mumbled Pettigrove. “I’ll
come up in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>The man went out and Cronshaw jumped up and
said: “You’ll pardon me, Mr. Pettigrove, I had no
idea that you had had a bereavement too.”</p>

<p>“My wife,” said Pettigrove dully, “two nights
ago.”</p>

<p>“Two nights ago! I am very sorry, most sorry,”
stammered the other, picking up his umbrella and
hat. “I’ll go away. What a sad coincidence!”</p>

<p>“There’s no call to do that; what’s got to be
done must be done.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not detain you long then, just a few details:
I am most sorry, very sorry, it’s extraordinary.”</p>

<p>He took out his notebook again—it had red edges
and a fat elastic band—and after conferring with
Pettigrove for some time the stranger went off to see
the vicar, saying, as he shook hands:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span> “I shall of
course see you again when it is all over. How
bewildering it is, and what a shock it is; from one
day to another, and then nothing; and the day after
to-morrow they’ll be buried beside one another. I
am very sorry, most sorry. I shall of course come
and see you again when it is all over.”</p>

<p>After he had gone Pettigrove walked about the
room murmuring: “She was a lady, a handsome
lady,” and then, still murmuring, he stumbled up the
stairs to the undertakers. His wife lay on the bed in a
white gown. He enveloped her stiff thin body in a
blanket and carried it downstairs to the parlour; the
others, with much difficulty, carried down the coffin
and when they had fixed it upon some trestles they
unwrapped Carrie from the blankets and laid her in
it.</p>

<p>Caroline and Carrie were buried on the same day
in adjoining graves, buried by the same men, and as
the ironmonger was prevented by some other misfortune
from attending the obsequies there were no
other mourners than Pettigrove. The workshop
sign of the Tull carpenter bore the following notice:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="">

<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">Small</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">☞ COMPLETE UNDERTAKER &nbsp;</td><td align="left">Hearse</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">Kept.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p class="pnind">and therefore it was he who ushered the handsome
lady from the station on that bitter day. Frost was
so heavy that the umbrage of pine and fir looked
woolly, thick grey swabs. Horses stood miserably
in the frozen fields, breathing into any friendly bush.
Rooks pecked industriously at the tough pastures,
but wiser fowls, unlike the fabulous good child, could
be neither seen nor heard. And all day someone was
grinding corn at the millhouse; the engine was old
and kept on emitting explosions that shook the
neighbourhood like a dreadful bomb. Pettigrove,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
who had not provided himself with a black overcoat
and therefore wore none at all, shivered so intensely
during the ceremony that the keen edge of his grief
was dulled, and indeed from that time onwards his
grief, whatever its source, seemed deprived of all
keenness: it just dulled him with a permanent dullness.</p>

<p>He caused to be placed on his wife’s grave a headstone,
quite small, not a yard high, inscribed to</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Caroline</span><br />
The beloved wife<br />
of<br />
John Pettigrove</p>

<p>Some days after its erection he was astonished to
find the headstone had fallen flat on its face. It was
very strange, but after all it was a small matter, a
simple affair, so in the dusk he himself took a spade
and set it up again. A day or two later it had fallen
once more. He was now inclined to some suspicion,
he fancied that mischievous boys had done it; he
would complain to the vicar. But Pettigrove was an
easy-going man, he did not complain; he replaced
the stone, setting it more deeply in the earth and
padding the turf more firmly around it.</p>

<p>When it fell the third time he was astonished and
deeply moved, but he was no longer in doubt, and as
he once more made a good upheaval by the grave in
the dusk he said in his mind, and he felt too in his
heart, that he understood.</p>

<p>“It will not fall again,” he said, and he was right:
it did not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span></p>

<p>Pettigrove himself lived for another score of years,
during which the monotony of his life was but mildly
varied; he just went on registering births and deaths
and rearing little oaks and pines, firs and sycamores.
Sentimental deference to the oft-repeated wish of his
wife led him to join the church choir and sing its
anthems and hymns with a secular blitheness that was
at least mellifluous. Moreover, after a year or two,
he <i>did</i> become a parish councillor and in a modest way
was something of a “shining light.”</p>

<p>“If I were you,” observed an old countryman to
him, “and I had my way, I know what I would do:
I would live in a little house and have a quiet life,
and I wouldn’t care the toss of a ha’penny for nothing
and nobody!”</p>

<p>In the time of May, always, Pettigrove would
wander in Tull Great Wood as far as the hidden
pleasaunce where the hawthorn so whitely bloomed.
None but he knew of that, or remembered it, and
when its dying petals were heaped upon the grass he
gathered handfuls to keep in his pocket till they
rotted. Sometimes he thought he would leave Tull
and see something of the world; he often thought of
that, but it seemed as if time had stabilized and
contracted round his heart and he did not go. At
last, after twenty years of widowhood, he died and
was buried, and this was the manner of that.</p>

<p>Two men were digging his grave on the morning
of the interment, a summer’s day so everlasting
beautiful that it was incredible anyone should be dead.
The two men, an ancient named Jethro and a younger
whom he called Mark, went to sit in the cool porch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
for a brief rest. The work on the grave had been
very much delayed, but now the old headstone was
laid on one side, and most of the earth that had covered
his wife’s body was heaped in untidy mounds upon
the turf close by. Otherwise there was no change in
the yard or the trees that grew so high, the grass that
grew so greenly, the dark brick wall, or the door of
fugitive blue; there was even a dappled goat quietly
cropping. A woman came into the porch, remarked
upon the grand day, and then passed into the church
to her task of tidying up for the ceremony. Jethro
took a swig of drink from a bottle and handed it to
his mate.</p>

<p>“You don’t remember old Fan as used to clean
the church, do you? No, ’twas ’fore you come about
these parts. She was a smartish old gal. Bother me
if one of they goats didn’t follow her into the darn
church one day, ah, and wouldn’t be drove out on
it, neither, no, and she chasing of it from here to
there and one place and another but out it would not
go, that goat. And at last it act-u-ally marched up
into the pulpit and putt its two forelegs on the holy
book and said ’Baa-a-a!’” Here Jethro gave a
prolonged imitation of a goat’s cry. “Well, old
Fan had been a bit skeered but she was so overcome
by that bit of piety that, darn me, if she didn’t sit
down and play the organ for it!”</p>

<p>Mark received this narration with a lack-lustre
air and at once the two men resumed their work.
Meanwhile a man ascended the church tower; other
men had gone into the home of the dead man. Soon
the vicar came hurrying through the blue door in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
the wall and the bell gave forth its first solemn
toll.</p>

<p>“Hey, Jethro,” called Mark from the grave.
“What d’you say’s the name of this chap?”</p>

<p>“Pettigrove. Hurry up, now.”</p>

<p>Mark, after bending down, whispered from the
grave: “What was his wife’s name?”</p>

<p>“Why, man alive, that ’ud be Pettigrove, too.”</p>

<p>The bell in the tower gave another profoundly
solemn beat.</p>

<p>“What’s the name on that headstone?” asked
Mark.</p>

<p>“Caroline Pettigrove. What be you thinking
on?”</p>

<p>“We’re in the wrong hole, Jethro; come and see
for yourself, the plate on this old coffin says Caroline
Cronshaw, see for yourself, we’re in the wrong hole.”</p>

<p>Again the bell voiced its melancholy admonition.</p>

<p>Jethro descended the short ladder and stood in the
grave with Mark just as the cortège entered the
church by the door on the opposite side of the yard.
He knelt down and rubbed with his own fingers the
dulled inscription on the mouldering coffin; there
was no doubt about it, Caroline Cronshaw lay there.</p>

<p>“Well, may I go to glory,” slowly said the old
man. It may have occurred to Mark that this was an
extravagantly remote destination to prescribe; at any
rate he said: “There ain’t no time, now, come on.”</p>

<p>“Who the devil be she? However come that
wrong headstone to be putt on this wrong grave?”
quavered the kneeling man.</p>

<p>“Are you coming out?” growled Mark, standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
with one foot on the ladder, “or ain’t you? They’ll
be chucking him on top of you in a couple o’ minutes.
There’s no time, I tell you.”</p>

<p>“’Tis a strange come-up as ever I see,” said the
old man; striking one wall of the grave with his
hand: “that’s where we should be, Mark, next door,
but there’s no time to change it and it must go as it is,
Mark. Well, it’s fate; what is to be must be
whether it’s good or right and you can’t odds it, you
darn’t go against it, or you be wrong.” They stood in
the grave muttering together. “Not a word, Mark,
mind you!” At last they shovelled some earth
back upon the tell-tale name-plate, climbed out of the
grave, drew up the ladder, and stood with bent heads
as the coffin was borne from the church towards them.
It was lowered into the grave, and at the “earth to
earth” Jethro, with a flirt of his spade dropped in a
handful of sticky marl, another at “ashes to ashes,”
and again at the “dust to dust.” Finally, when they
were alone together again, they covered in the old
lovers, dumping the earth tightly and everlastingly
about them, and reset the headstone, Jethro remarking
as they did so: “That headstone, well, ’tis a
mystery, Mark! And I can’t bottom it, I can’t
bottom it at all, ’tis a mystery.”</p>

<p>And indeed, how should it not be, for the secret
had long since been forgotten by its originator.</p>

<h2 id="The_Fancy_Dress_Ball"><i>The Fancy Dress Ball</i></h2>


<p>There was a young fellow named
Bugloss. He wore cufflinks made of agate with
studs to match but was otherwise an agreeable person
who suffered much from a remarkable diffidence,
one of nature’s minor inconsistencies having been to
endow him with a mute desire for romantic adventure
and an entire incapacity to inaugurate any such thing.</p>

<p>It was in architecture that he found his way of life,
quite a profitable and genteel way; for while other
hands and heads devised the mere details of drainage,
of window and wall, staircase, cupboard, and floor,
in fact each mechanical thing down to the hooks and
bells in every room, he it was who painted those
entrancing draughts of elevation and the general
prospect (with a few enigmatic but graceful trees,
clouds in the offing, and a tiny postman plodding
sideways up the carriage drive) which lured the fond
fly into the architectural parlour. It must be confessed
that he himself lived in rooms over the shop
of a hairdresser, whose window displayed the
elegantly coiffed head and bust of a wax lady suffering
either from an acute attack of jaundice or the effects
of a succession of late nights: next door was an
establishment dealing exclusively, but not exhaustingly,
in mangles and perambulators. In Bugloss’s
room there were two bell handles with wires looking
very handy and complete, yet whenever he desired
the attendance of the maid he had (<i>a</i>) to take a silver
whistle from his pocket; (<i>b</i>) to open the door; and
(<i>c</i>) to blow it smartly in the passage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span></p>

<p>His exceeding shyness was humiliating to himself
and annoying to people of friendly disposition, it
could not have been more preposterous had he been
condemned to wear a false nose; he might have gone
(he may even now be going) to his grave without
once looking into a woman’s eyes. What a pity!
His own eyes were worth looking at; he was really
a nice young man, tall and slender with light fluffy
hair, who if he couldn’t hide his amiable light under a
bushel certainly behaved as if it wasn’t there. Things
were so until one day he chanced to read with envious
pleasure but a good deal of scepticism a book called
<i>Anatol</i> by a Viennese writer; almost immediately
the fascinating possibilities of romantic infidelity
were confirmed by a quarrel which began in the
hairdresser’s house between the young hairdresser
and his wife, Monsieur and Madame Rabignol, and
lasted for a week in the course of which Bugloss
learned that the hairdresser was indulging in precisely
one of those intrigues with an unknown lady
living somewhere near by; Madame Rabignol,
charming but virulent, protested a thousand times
that it must be a base woman who walked the streets
at night, and that Monsieur Rabignol was a low pig.
The fair temptress, it appeared, was given to the use
of a toilet unguent with the beguiling misdescription
of “Vanishing Face Cream”; that was an unfortunate
circumstance, because the wife of the hairdresser,
a very cute woman, on her husband’s return
from an evening’s absence, invariably kissed him and
smelt him.</p>

<p>“Evil communications,” saith St. Paul (borrowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
the phrase from Menander), “corrupt good manners,”
and his notion must have something of truth
in it, for these domestic revelations produced an
unusual stir in the Bugloss bosom—he bought a
ticket for a popular fancy dress ball and made a
mighty resolve to discard his pusillanimous self with
one grand gesture and there and then take the plunge.
At a fancy dress ball you could do that; everyone
made a fool of himself more or less; and Bugloss
determined to plunge into whatever there was to
plunge in. This was desperately unwise, but you are
not to suppose that he harboured any looseness or
want of principle; he was good and modest, and
virtuous as any young man could possibly be; he
only hoped, at the very least, to look some fair girl
deep in the eyes. So he designed an oriental costume,
simple to make (being loose-fitting), and having
bought quantities of purple and crimson fabric he
wrapped them up and sent the office-boy with his
design, materials, measurements, and instructions to
a dressmaker in the neighbourhood, whom he wisely
thought would make a better job of it than a tailor.
When the costume was finished he was delighted;
it was magnificent, resplendent, artistic, and the
dressmaker’s charge was moderate.</p>

<p>On the night of the ball, a warm August night with
soft thrilling air and a sky of sombre velvet, he drove
in a closed cab. Dancing was in the open, the lawns
of a mansion were lent for the occasion, and Bugloss
went rather late to escape notice—nearly eleven o’clock—but
in the cab his timorousness conspiring against
him had deepened to palpitating dejection; he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
afraid again, the grand gesture was forgotten, and his
attire was fantastically guarded from the public eye.
From his window he had watched the arrival of the
cab and had slunk down to it secretly—not a word to
the Rabignols!—in a bowler hat and a mackintosh
that reached to his feet; his fancy shoes were concealed
under a pair of goloshes, the bright tasselled
cap was in his pocket.</p>

<p>Heavens! It was too painful. This was no
plunge, this miserable sink or swim—it was delirium,
hell—what a stupid man he had been to come—it was
no go, it was useless—and he was about to order the
cabman to turn back home when the cab stopped at
the gates of the mansion, the door was flung open and
a big policeman almost dragged him out upon the
carpeted pavement. A knot of jocular bystanders
caused him to scurry into the grounds where three
officials—good, bad, and indifferent—examined his
ticket and directed him onwards. But the cloak
rooms were right across the grounds, the great lawn
was simply a bath of illumination, the band played
in the centre and the dancers, madly arrayed, were
waltzing madly. Bugloss, desiring only some far
corner of darkness to flee into, saw on all sides shadowy
trees, dim shrubs, and walks that led to utter gloom—thank
God!—and there was a black moonless sky,
though even that seemed positively to drip with stars.</p>

<p>At this moment the big policeman, following after
him, said: “What about this cab, sir?”</p>

<p>“What—yes—this cab!” repeated Bugloss, and
to his agonized imagination every eye in the grounds
became ironically fixed upon him alone; even the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
music ceased, and there resounded a flutter of
coruscating amiability.</p>

<p>“D’ye want him to wait?” the policeman was
grinning—“He ain’t got any orders.”</p>

<p>“O, O dear, how much, what’s his fare? I don’t
want him again and—gracious! I haven’t a cent
on me—what, what—O, please tell him to call at my
house to-morrow. Pay him then I will. Please!”</p>

<p>“Righto, my lord!” said the big policeman,
saluting—he was a regular joker that fellow. Then
Bugloss, trembling in every limb, almost leapt
towards one of the dark walks, away from those
grinning eyes. The shrubs and trees concealed him,
though even here an odd paper lantern or two consorted
with a few coloured bulbs of light. Shortly he
began his observations.</p>

<p>The cloak rooms, he found, could be approached
only by crossing the lawn. In a mackintosh, goloshes,
and a bowler hat, that was too terrific an ordeal; the
trembling Israelite during that affrighting passage of
the Red Sea had all the incitements of escape and the
comfort of friends, but this more violent ordeal led
into captivity, and Bugloss was alone. What was
to be done? The music began again and it was agreeable,
the illuminations were lustrous and pretty, the
dancers gay, but Bugloss was neither agreeable nor
gay, and his prettiness was not yet on the surface.
He was in a highly wrought condition, he was limp,
and he remained in what seclusion he could find in
the garden, peering like a sinner at some assembly of
the blest. At last he snatched off his goloshes and
stuffed them in his pocket. “So far,” he murmured,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
“so good. I will hide the mackintosh among the
bushes, I can’t face that dressing room.” Just then
the band gave a heightened blare, drum and cymbals
were rapidly beaten and the music ceased amid
clapping and polite halloing. “Dash it, I must wait
till the next dance,” said Bugloss, “and, O lord,
there’s a lot of them coming this way.” He turned to
retreat into deeper darkness when suddenly, near the
musicians, he saw a fascinating girl, a dainty but
startling figure skimming across the lawn as if to
overtake a friend. Why—yes—she had a wig of
bright green hair, green; a short-waisted cherry silk
jacket and harlequin pantaloons, full at the hips but
narrowing to the ankles, where white stockings
slipped into a pair of gilded leather shoes with heels
of scarlet. Delicately charming were her face and
figure, entrancing were her movements, and she
tinkled all over with hidden bells.</p>

<p>“Sweet God, what beauty!” thought Bugloss,
“this is She, the Woman to know, I must, I must ...
but how?”</p>

<p>She disappeared. For the moment he could not
rid himself of the bowler hat and mackintosh, so
many couples roamed in the dark glades; wherever
he went he could see the glow of cigarettes, generally
in twos, and there were whispering or silent couples
standing about in unexpected places. Retiring to the
darkest corner he had previously found he was about
to discard his mackintosh when he was startled by a
cry at his elbow: “Lena, where are you, what’s
that?” and a girl scuttled away, calling “Lena!
Lena!” Her terror dismayed him, the little shock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
itself brought the sweat to his brow, but the music
beginning again drew all the stragglers back to the
lawn. There, from his gloomy retreat, he beheld the
green-haired beauty in the arms of a pirate king who
was adorned with an admiral’s hat and a dangerous
moustache. “If,” thought Bugloss, still in his
mufti, “I couldn’t have discovered a better get-up
than that fellow, I’d have stayed away. There’s no
picture in it, it’s just silly, I couldn’t wear a thing like
that, I couldn’t wear it, I’d have perished rather than
come.” And indeed there was an absence of imagination
about all the male adornment; many of the
ladies were right enough, but some were horrors, and
most of the men were horrors; there was justification
for Bugloss’s subsequent reflection: “I’ll show them,
a little later on, what can be done when an artist takes
the thing in hand; now after this dance is over....
etc., etc.”</p>

<p>Two lovers startled him by beginning to quarrel.
They were passing among the trees behind him and
talking quite loudly, both with a slight foreign accent.
“But I shall not let you go, Johannes,” said the lady
with a fierce little cry. Bugloss turned and could just
discern a lady costumed as a vivandière; her companion
was in the uniform Of a Danish soldier.</p>

<p>“If you forced me to stop I would kill you,”
retorted the man.</p>

<p>“O, you would kill me!”</p>

<p>“If you forced me to stop.”</p>

<p>“You would kill me ... so!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>
<p>“Yes, I would kill you.”</p>

<p>“But you have told me that if I <i>can</i> keep you here
in England I may do it. You know. If I can. You
know that, Johannes!”</p>

<p>Bugloss was persuaded that he had heard her voice
before, though he could not recognize the speaker.</p>

<p>“Be quiet, you are a fool,” the man said. That
was all Bugloss heard. It was brutal enough. If
only a woman, any woman, had wanted <i>him</i> like that!</p>

<p>He wandered about during other dances. The
green-haired girl was always with that idiotic pirate,
and it made things very difficult, because although
Bugloss had fallen desperately in love with her he
could not, simply could not, march up and drag her
away from her companion. He could not as yet even
venture from his ambush among the trees, and they
never wandered in the gloom—they were always
dancing together or eating together. He, Bugloss,
had no interest in any other woman there, no spark of
interest whatsoever. That being so, why go to all the
fuss of discarding the mackintosh and making an exhibition
of himself? Why go bothering among that
crowd, he was not a dancer at all, he didn’t want to go!
But still ... by and by perhaps ... when that lovely
treasure was not so extraordinarily engaged. Sweet
God! she was just ... well, but he could not stand
much more of that infernal pirate’s antics with her.
Withdrawing his tantalized gaze he sat down in
darkness behind a clump of yew trimmed in the shape
of some fat animal that resembled a tall hippopotamus.
Here he lit his tenth cigarette. At once a dizziness
assailed him, he began to see scarlet splashes in the
gloom, to feel as if he were being lacerated with tiny
pins. Throwing the cigarette away he stretched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
himself at full length under the bush. Scarcely had
he done so when he became aware that two others
were sitting down on the other side of it, the same
foreign couple, the vivandière and her threatening
cavalier.</p>

<p>“Listen to me, Hélène,” the man was saying in a
soft consoling voice, “you shall trust to me and come
away. Together we will go. But here I cannot stay.
It is fate. You love, eh? Come then, we will go to
Copenhagen, I will take you to my country. Now,
Hélène!”</p>

<p>The lady made no reply; Bugloss felt that she must
be crying. The Dane continued to woo and the
Frenchwoman to murmur back to him: “Is it not so,
Johannes?” “No, Hélène, no.” But at last he
cried angrily: “Pah! Then stop with your bandit,
that pig! Pah!” and chattering angrily in his strange
language he sprang up and stalked away. Hélène
rose too and followed him beseechingly into the
gloom: “No, no, Johannes, no!”</p>

<p>Bugloss got up from the grass; his dizziness was
gone. He knew that voice, it seemed impossible, but
he knew her, and he had half a mind to rush home:
but being without his watch and unable to discover
what o’clock it was, he did not care to walk out into
the streets with the chance of being guyed by any
half-drunken sparks passing late home. He would
wait, he was sure it was past midnight now, there
would be a partial exodus soon, and he would go off
unnoticed in the crowd. There was no more
possibility now of him shedding his coat and joining
the revellers than there was of that beauteous girl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
flying into his arms; his inhibition possessed him
with tenfold power, he was an imbecile. Sad, pitiful,
wretched, outcast! Through the screen of foliage
the music floated with exquisite faintness, luminous
cadenzas from a gleaming but guarded Eldorado
whose light was music, whose music was all a promise
and a mockery; he was a miserable prisoner pent in
his own unbearable but unbreakable shackles and
dressed up like a doll in a pantomime! Many people
had come in their ordinary clothes; why, O why had
he put on this maddening paralysing raiment? Why
had he come at all?</p>

<p>Some of the lights had begun to fade; at one end
of the lawn most of the small lamps had guttered out,
leaving a line of a dozen chairs in comparative
obscurity. Weary of standing, he slunk to the corner
chair and sat down with a sigh. Just beside him was
a weeping ash that he supposed only looked happy
when it rained, and opposite was a poplar straining
so hard to brush the heavens that he fancied it would
be creaking in every limb. By and by an elderly
decorous lady, accompanied by two girls not so
decorous—the one arrayed as a Puritan maiden and
the other as a Scout mistress—came and sat near him,
but he did not move. They did not perceive the
moody Bugloss. The elderly lady spoke: “Do go
and fetch her here; no, when this waltz is over. She
is very rude, but I want to see her. I can’t understand
why she avoids us, and how she is getting on is
a mystery to everybody. Bring her here.”</p>

<p>The puritan maiden and the scout mistress, embracing
each other, skipped away to the refreshment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
booth. Glorious people sat about there drinking
wine as if they disliked it, sipping ices as if it were
a penance, and eating remarkable food or doing
some other reasonable things, but Bugloss dared not
join them although he was very hungry. It was not
hunger he wanted to avert, but an impending tragedy.</p>

<p>The hypersensitive creature sees in the common
mass of his fellows only something that seeks to deny
him, and either in fear of that antagonism or in the
knowledge of his own imperfections he isolates and
envelopes the real issue of his being—much as an
oyster does with the irritant grain in its beard; only
the outcome is seldom a pearl and not always as useful
as a fish. Bugloss was still wholly enveloped, and his
predicament gave a melancholy tone to his thoughts.
He sat hunched in his chair until the dance ended and
the two girls came back, bringing with them the
lovely green-haired one!</p>

<p>“Hello, aunt,” she cried merrily enough, “why
aren’t you in costume? Like my get-up?”</p>

<p>Without a word the elderly lady kissed her, and all
sat down within a few feet of Bugloss. It thrilled
him to hear her voice; at least he would be able to
recognize that when she turned back again to daylight’s
cool civilities.</p>

<p>“Did you know that I had blossomed out in
business?” she was saying. Bugloss thought it a
beautiful voice.</p>

<p>“I heard of it,” said her aunt, whom you may
figure as a lady with a fan, eyeglasses, and the repellant
profile of a bird of prey,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span> “about half an hour ago.
I wish I had heard of it before.”</p>

<p>“I am a full-blown modiste.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you might have told me.”</p>

<p>“But I have told you.”</p>

<p>“You might have told me before.”</p>

<p>“But I haven’t seen you before, aunt.”</p>

<p>“No, we haven’t seen you. How is this business,
Claire, is it thriving, making money?”</p>

<p>“O, we get along, aunt,” said the radiant niece in a
tone of almost perverse amiability. “I have several
assistants. Do you know, we made seven of the
costumes for this ball—seven—one of them for a
man.”</p>

<p>“I thought ladies only made for ladies.”</p>

<p>“So did I, but this order just dropped in upon us
very mysteriously, and we did it, from top to toe,
a most gorgeous arrangement, all crimson and purple
and silver and citron, but I haven’t seen anybody
wearing it yet. I wonder if you have? I’m so
disappointed. It’s a sultan, or a nabob, or a nankipoo
of some kind, I am certain it was for this ball. I was
so anxious to see it worn. I had made up my mind
to dance at least half the dances with the wearer, it
was so lovely. Have you seen such a costume
here?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the aunt grimly, “I have not, but I
have noticed the pirate king—did you make his
costume too? I hope not!”</p>

<p>“O no, aunt,” laughed Claire, “isn’t he a fright?”</p>

<p>“Who is he?”</p>

<p>“That? O, a friend of mine, a business friend.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span></p>
<p>“He seems fond of you.”</p>

<p>“I have known him some time. Yes, I like him.
Don’t you like my pirate king?” asked Claire,
turning to her two cousins.</p>

<p>The cousins both thought he was splendid.</p>

<p>(“Good God!” groaned Bugloss.)</p>

<p>“I don’t,” declared auntie. “Do you know him
very well, has he any intentions? An orphan girl
living by herself—you have your way to make in the
world—I am not presuming to criticize, my dear
Claire, but is it wise? Who is he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, aunt,” said Claire. Bugloss could hear the
tinkle of her bells as she moved a little restlessly.</p>

<p>“Are his intentions honourable? I should think
they were otherwise.”</p>

<p>Claire did not reply immediately. It looked as if
the musicians were about to resume. There was a
rattle of plates and things over at the booth. Then
she said reflectively: “I don’t think he has any—what
you call honourable intentions.”</p>

<p>“Not! Is he a bad man?”</p>

<p>“O no, I don’t mean that, aunt, no.”</p>

<p>“But what do you mean then, you’re a strange
girl, what <i>could</i> his intentions be?”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t any intentions at all.”</p>

<p>“Not one way or the other?”</p>

<p>Claire seemed vaguely to hover over the significance
of this. She said calmly enough: “Not in any
way. He’s my hairdresser, a Frenchman, and so
clever. He made this beautiful wig and gave it me.
What do you think of my beautiful wig, isn’t it
sweet?”</p>

<p>There was a note of exasperation in the elder
woman’s voice:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span> “Why don’t you get married, girl?”</p>

<p>“I’d rather work,” said Claire, “and besides, he’s
already married.”</p>

<p>The music did begin, and a gentleman garbed as a
druid came to claim auntie for a dance. The three
girls were left alone.</p>

<p>“Did he <i>really</i> give you that wig?” asked the
puritan maiden.</p>

<p>“Yes, isn’t it bonny? I love it.” She shook the
dangling curls about her face. “He’s frightfully
clever with hair. French! You know his saloon
probably, Rabignol’s in the High Street. His wife
is here, you must have seen her too—a French soldier
woman—what do you call them? She hates me.
She’s with a Danish captain. He <i>is</i> a Dane, but he is
really an ice merchant. He thinks she adores him.”</p>

<p>“O Claire!” cried the two shocked cousins.</p>

<p>“But she doesn’t,” said Claire. “Sakes, I’m
beginning to shiver; come along.”</p>

<p>They all romped back towards the orchestra.
Bugloss shivered too and was glad—yes, glad—that
she had gone. The tragedy had floated satisfactorily
out of his hands, thank the fates; it was Rabignol’s
affair. Damn Rabignol! Curse Rabignol! the
bandit, the pig! He hoped that Madame Rabignol
<i>would</i> elope with Johannes. He hoped the green-haired
girl—frail and lovely thing—would behave
well; and he hoped finally and frenziedly that
Rabignol himself would be choked by the common
hangman. Bugloss then wanted to yawn, but somehow
he could not. He put on his rubber goloshes
again. With unwonted audacity he stalked off
firmly, even a little fiercely, across the lawn in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
mackintosh and bowler hat, passing round the fringe
of the dancers but looking neither to the right nor to
the left, then out of the gates into the dark empty
streets and so home. There, feeling rather like a
Cromwell made of chutney, he disarrayed himself and
crept into bed yawning and murmuring to himself:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
“So that’s a fancy dress ball! Sweet God, but I’m
glad I went! And I could have shown them something,
I could have. Say what you like, but mine was
the finest costume at the show; there’s no doubt
about that, it was, it was! And I’m very glad I went.”</p>

<p>The chemist had certain odd
notions that were an agreeable reflex of his name,
which was Oddfellow—Herbert Oddfellow. Our
man was odd about diet. It was believed that he
lived without cookery, that he browsed, as it were,
upon fruit and salads. Ironically enough he earned
a considerable income by the sale of nostrums for
indigestion. At any hour of the day you were likely
to find him devouring apples, nibbling artichokes, or
sucking an orange, and your inquiry for a dose of
bismuth or some such aid would cause by an obscure
process a sardonic grin to assemble upon his face.
You would scarcely have expected to find a lot of
indigestion in the working-class neighbourhood
where his pharmacy flourished, but it was there,
certainly; he was quite cynical about it—his business
throve abundantly upon dietary disorders.</p>

<p>There were four big ornamental carboys in his
shop windows—red, violet, green, and yellow;
incidentally he sold peppermint drops and poisons,
and at forty years of age he was reputed to be the
happiest, as he was certainly the healthiest, man in the
county. This was not merely because he was unmarried
... but there, I declare this tale is not about
Oddfellow himself, but about his lethal chamber.</p>

<p>You must know that the sacrificial exactions of the
war did not spare cats and dogs. They, too, were
immolated—but painlessly—scores of them, at Oddfellow’s.
He was unhappy about that part of his
business, very much so; he loved animals, perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
rather more than people, for, naturally, what he
ministered to in his pharmacy was largely human
misery or human affectation. Evil cruel things—the
bolt of a gaol, the lime of the bird-snarer, the butcher’s
axe—maddened him.</p>

<p>In the small garden at the back of the dispensary
the interments were carried out by Horace the errand
boy, a juvenile with snub nose and short, tough hair,
who always wore ragged puttees. He delighted in
such obsequies, and had even instituted some ceremonial
orgies. But at last these lethal commissions
were so numerous that the burial-ground began to
resemble the habitat of some vast, inappeasable mole,
and thereupon Oddfellow had to stipulate for sorrowing
owners to conduct the interments themselves in
cemeteries of their own. Even this provision did
not quell the inflow of these easily disposable
victims.</p>

<p>Mr. Franks brought him a magnificent cat to be
destroyed. (Shortly afterwards Franks was conveyed
to the lunatic asylum, an institution which still
nurtures him in despotic durance.) Pending the
return of Horace, who was disbursing remedial
shrapnel to the neighbourhood, the cat, tied to a rail
in the shop, sat dozing in the sunlight.</p>

<p>“What a beautiful cat!” exclaimed a lady caller,
stroking its purring majesty. The lady herself was
beautiful. Oddfellow explained that its demise was
imminent—nothing the matter with it—owner didn’t
want it.</p>

<p>“How cruel, you sweet thing, how cruel!” pronounced
the lady, who really was very beautiful.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span> “I
would love to have it. Why shouldn’t I have it ...
if its owner doesn’t want it? I wonder. May I?”</p>

<p>Manlike was Oddfellow, beautiful was the lady;
the lady took the cat away. Twenty-four hours later
the shop counter was stormed by the detestable
Franks, incipient insanity already manifest in him.
He carried the selfsame cat under his arm—it had
returned to its old home. Franks assailed the
abashed chemist with language that at its mildest
was abusive and libellous. His chief complaint
seemed to repose upon the circumstance of having
<i>paid</i> for the cat’s destruction, whereupon Oddfellow
who, like an Irishman, never walked into an argument—he
simply bounced in—threw down the fee
upon the counter and urged Mr. Franks to take his
cat, and his money, and himself away as speedily as
might be. This reprehensible behaviour did by no
means allay the tension; the madman-designate
paraded many further signs of his impending doom.</p>

<p>“Take your cat away, I tell you,” shouted Oddfellow,
“take it away. I wouldn’t destroy it for a
thousand pounds!”</p>

<p>“You won’t, oh?”</p>

<p>“Put an end to you with pleasure!”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“Make you a present of a dose of poison whenever
you like to come and take it!”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“I will!”</p>

<p>Franks went away with his tom-cat.</p>

<p>“O ... my ... lord!” ejaculated the chemist, that
being his favourite evocation;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span> “I’ll do no more of
this cat-and-dog business. I shall not do any more;
no, I shall not. I do not like it at all.”</p>

<p>But in the afternoon his assistant, who had not been
informed of this resolve, accepted two more victims
for the lethal chamber, another tom-cat and a collie
dog.</p>

<p>“O ... my ... lord!” groaned the chemist distractedly;
but there was no help for it, and, calling
his boy Horace, they carried the cat into the storeroom.
The lethal box was in a corner; all round
were shelves of costly drugs. The place did not
smell of death; it smelt of paint, oils, volatile spirits,
tubs of white lead, and packing-cases that contained
scented soap or feeding-bottles. As Oddfellow prepared
his syringe, a sporting friend named Jerry
peeped in to watch the proceedings.</p>

<p>“Shut the door!” cried little Horace. “I can’t
hold him.... He’s off!”</p>

<p>Sure enough the cat, sensing its danger, had burst
from his arms and sprung to one of the shelves.
Immediately phials of drugs began to fall and smash
upon the floor, and as the cat rushed and scurried
from their grasp disaster was heaped upon disaster;
the green, glowing eyes, the rigid teeth, that seemed
to grow as large as a tiger’s, confounded them, and
the havoc deterred them; they dared not approach the
spitting fury, it was a wild beast again, and a bold one.</p>

<p>“O ... my ... lord!” said Oddfellow, also swearing
softly, for bottles continued to slip from shelf to
floor. “What’s to be done?”</p>

<p>“Open the door—let the flaming thing go,” said
Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span></p>

<p>“No fear,” replied the chemist, “I’ve had enough
of these dead cats turning up like Banquo’s ghost—just
enough.”</p>

<p>Horace intervened. “My father’s got a gun, sir;
shall I run round home and get it?”</p>

<p>Jerry’s eyes began to gleam, the costly phials kept
dropping to the floor—the chemist distractedly
agreed—the boy Horace ran home and fetched a
rook rifle. But his prowess was so poor, his aim so
disastrous—he shot a hole through a barrel of linseed
oil and received a powerful squirt of it in his eye—that
Jerry deprived him of the weapon. Even then
several rounds had to be fired, a carboy of acid was
cracked, a window smashed, a lamp blown to pieces,
before poor tom was finally subdued. Oddfellow had
gone into the shop. He could not bring himself to
witness the dismal slaughter. Every repercussion
sent a pang of pity to his heart, and when at last the
bleeding body of the cat was laid in the yard to await
removal by its owner he almost vomited and he
almost wept; if he had not sniffed the bunch of early
primroses in his buttonhole he would surely have
done one or the other.</p>

<p>“Now the dog,” whispered the chemist. The
collie was very subdued, good dog, he gave no trouble
at all, good dog, he was hustled into the big box, good
dog, and quietly chloroformed. Later on, a countryman
with his cart called for the body. The old
woman who owned it was going to make a hearthrug
with the skin. It was enveloped in a sack; the
countryman carried it out on his shoulder like a
butcher carrying the carcase of a sheep and flung it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
into the cart. The callousness of this struck Mr.
Oddfellow so profoundly that he announced there
and then, positively and finally, that he would undertake
no more business of that kind, and doubly to
insure this the lethal box was taken into the yard and
chopped up.</p>

<p>Now, the poor old woman who owned the dog
called next day at the chemist’s shop. Behind her
walked the very collie. For a moment or two Oddfellow
feared that he was to be haunted by the walking
ghost of cats and dogs for evermore. Said the old
woman: “Please, sir, you must do him again; he’s
woke up!”</p>

<p>She described at great length the dog’s strange
revival. It stood humbly enough in the background,
a little drowsy, but not at all uneasy.</p>

<p>“No,” cried Oddfellow firmly; “can’t do it—destroyed
my tackle. You take him home, ma’am;
he’s all right. Dog that’s been through that ought
to live a long life. Take him home again, ma’am,” he
urged, “he’s all right.”</p>

<p>The woman was old; she was feeble and poor;
she was not able to keep him now, he was such a big
dog. Wasn’t it hard enough to get him food, things
were so dear, and now there was the licence money
due! She hadn’t got it; she never would have it;
she really couldn’t afford it.</p>

<p>“You take him, sir, and keep him, sir.”</p>

<p>“No, I can’t keep a dog—no room.”</p>

<p>“Have him, sir,” she pleaded; “you’ll be kind
to him.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span></p>
<p>“No, no; ... but ... if it’s only his licence ...
I’ll tell you what. I’ll pay for his licence rather than
destroy him.”</p>

<p>Putting his hand into the till, he laid three half-crowns
before her. The old woman stared at the
chemist, but she stared still more at the money. Then,
thanking him with quaint, confused dignity, she
gathered it up, but again stood gazing meditatively
at the three big coins, now lying, so unexpectedly,
in her thin palm.</p>

<p>“Good dog,” said the chemist, giving him a final
pat. “Good dog!”</p>

<p>Then the poor old woman, with tears in her eyes,
turned out of Mr. Oddfellow’s shop and, followed
by her dog, walked off to a quarter of the town where
there was another chemist who kept a lethal chamber.</p>

<h2 id="The_Wife_of_Ted_Wickham"><i>The Wife of Ted Wickham</i></h2>


<p>Perhaps it is a mercy we can’t
see ourselves as others see us. Molly Wickham
was a remarkable pretty woman in days gone by;
maybe she is wiser since she has aged, but when she
was young she was foolish. She never seemed to
realize it, but I wasn’t deceived.</p>

<p>So said the cattle-dealer, a healthy looking man,
massive, morose, and bordering on fifty. He did not
say it to anybody in particular, for it was said—it was
to himself he said it—privately, musingly, as if to
soothe the still embittered recollection of a beauty
that was foolish, a fondness that was vain.</p>

<p>Ted Wickham himself was silly, too, when he
married her. Must have been extraordinarily
touched to marry a little soft, religious, teetotal party
like her, and him a great sporting cock of a man, just
come into a public-house business that his aunt had
left him, “The Half Moon,” up on the Bath Road.
He always ate like an elephant, but she’d only the
appetite of a scorpion. And what was worse, he was
a true blood conservative while all her family were a
set of radicals that you couldn’t talk sense to: if you
only so much as mentioned the name of Gladstone they
would turn their eyes up to the ceiling as if he was a
saint in glory. Blood is thicker than water, I know,
but it’s unnatural stuff to drink so much of. Grant
their name was. They christened her Pamela, and
as if that wasn’t cruel enough they messed her initials
up by giving her the middle name of Isabel.</p>

<p>But she was a handsome creature, on the small side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
but sound as a roach and sweet as an apple tree in
bloom. Pretty enough to convert Ted, and I thought
she would convert him, but she was a cussed woman—never
did what you would expect of her—and so
she didn’t even try. She gave up religion herself,
gave it up altogether and went to church no more.
That was against her inclination, but of course it was
only right, for Ted never could have put up with that.
Wedlock’s one thing and religion’s two: that’s odd
and even: a little is all very well if it don’t go a long
ways. Parson Twamley kept calling on her for a
year or two afterwards, trying to persuade her to
return to the fold—he couldn’t have called oftener if
she had owed him a hundred pound—but she would
not hear of it, she would not go. He was not much
of a parson, not one to wake anybody up, but he had a
good delivery, and when he’d the luck to get hold of a
sermon of any sense his delivery was very good, very
good indeed. She would say: “No, sir, my feelings
aren’t changed one bit, but I won’t come to church any
more, I’ve my private reasons.” And the parson
would glare across at old Ted as if he were a Belzeboob,
for Ted always sat and listened to the parson
chattering to her. Never said a word himself,
always kept his pipe stuck in his jaw. Ted never
persuaded her in the least, just left it to her, and she
would come round to his manner of thinking in the
end, for though he never actually said it, she always
knew what his way of thinking was. A strange thing,
it takes a real woman to do that, silly or no! At
election times she would plaster the place all over
with tory bills, do it with her own hands!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span></p>

<p>Still, there’s no stability in meekness of that sort,
a weathervane can only go with wind and weather, and
there was no sense in her giving in to Ted as she did,
not in the long run, for he couldn’t help but despise
her. A man wants something or other to whet the
edge of his life on; and he did despise her, I know.</p>

<p>But she was a fine creature in her way, only her
way wasn’t his. A beautiful woman, too, well-limbered
up, with lovely hair, but always a very proper
sort, a milksop—Ted told me once that he had never
seen her naked. Well, can you wonder at the man?
And always badgering him to do things that could
not be done at the time. To have “The Half Moon”
painted, or enlarged, or insured: she’d keep on
badgering him, and he could not make her see that
any god’s amount of money spent on paint wouldn’t
improve the taste of liquor.</p>

<p>“I can see as far into a quart pot as the King of
England,” he says, “and I know that if this bar was
four times as big as ’tis a quart wouldn’t hold a drop
more then than it does now.”</p>

<p>“No, of course,” she says.</p>

<p>“Nor a drop less neither,” says Ted. He showed
her that all the money expended on improvements and
insurance and such things were so much off something
else. Ted was a generous chap—liked to see plenty
of everything, even though he had to give some of it
away. But you can’t make some women see some
things.</p>

<p>“Not a roof to our heads, nor a floor to our feet,
nor a pound to turn round on if a fire broke out,”
Molly would say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span></p>

<p>“But why should a fire break out?” he’d ask her.
“There never has been a fire here, there never ought
to be a fire here, and what’s more, there never will be
a fire here, so why should there be a fire?”</p>

<p>And of course she let him have his own way, and
they never had a fire there while he was alive, though
I don’t know that any great harm would have been
done anyways, for after a few years trade began to
slacken off, and the place got dull, and what with the
taxes it was not much more than a bread and cheese
business. Still, there’s no matter of that: a man
don’t ask for a bed of roses: a world without some
disturbance or anxiety would be like a duckpond
where the ducks sleep all day and are carried off at
night by the foxes.</p>

<p>Molly was like that in many things, not really
contrary, but no tact. After Ted died she kept on at
“The Half Moon” for a year or two by herself, and
regular as clockwork every month Pollock, the insurance
manager, would drop in and try for to persuade
her to insure the house or the stock or the furniture,
any mortal thing. Well, believe you, when she had
only got herself to please in the matter that woman
wouldn’t have anything to say to that insurance—she
never did insure, and never would.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t run such a risk; upon my soul it’s
flying in the face of possibilities, Mrs. Wickham”—he
was a palavering chap, that Pollock; a tall fellow
with sandy hair, and he always stunk of liniment for
he had asthma on the chest—“A very grave risk, it
is indeed,” he would say,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span> “the Meazer’s family
was burnt clean out of hearth and home last St.
Valentine’s day, and if they hadn’t taken up a policy
what would have become of those Meazers?”</p>

<p>“I dunno,” Molly says—that was the name Ted
give her—“I dunno, and I’m sorry for unfortunate
people, but I’ve my private reasons.”</p>

<p>She was always talking about her private reasons,
and they must have been devilish private, for not a
soul on God’s earth ever set eyes on them.</p>

<p>“Well, Mrs. Wickham,” says Pollock, “they’d
have been a tidy ways up Queer Street, and ruin’s a
long-lasting affair,” Pollock says. He was a rare
palavering chap, and he used to talk about Gladstone,
too, for he knew her family history; but that didn’t
move her, and she did not insure.</p>

<p>“Yes, I quite agree,” she says, “but I’ve my
private reasons.”</p>

<p>Sheer female cussedness! But where her own husband
couldn’t persuade her Pollock had no chance at
all. And then, of course, two years after Ted died she
did go and have a fire there. “The Half Moon” was
burnt clean out, rafter and railings, and she had to
give it up and shift into the little bullseye business
where she is now, selling bullseyes to infants and
ginger beer to boy scholars on bicycles. And what
does it all amount to? Why, it don’t keep her in
hairpins. She had the most beautiful hair once. But
that’s telling the story back foremost.</p>

<p>Ted was a smart chap, a particular friend of mine
(so was Molly), and he could have made something
of himself and of his business, perhaps, if it hadn’t
been for her. He was a sportsman to the backbone;
cricket, shooting, fishing, always game for a bit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
life, any mortal thing—what was there he couldn’t
do? And a perfect demon with women, I’ve never
seen the like. If there was a woman for miles around
as he couldn’t come at, then you could bet a crown
no one else could. He had the gift. Well, when one
woman ain’t enough for a man, twenty ain’t too many.
He and me were in a tight corner together more than
once, but he never went back on a friend, his word
was his Bible oath. And there was he all the while
tied up to this soft wife of his, who never once let on
she knew of it at all, though she knowed much. And
never would she cast the blink of her eyes—splendid
eyes they were, too—on any willing stranger, nor
even a friend, say, like myself; it was all Ted this
and Ted that, though I was just her own age and Ted
was twelve years ahead of us both. She didn’t know
her own value, wouldn’t take her opportunities,
hadn’t the sense, as I say, though she had got everything
else. Ah, she was a woman to be looking at
once, and none so bad now; she wears well.</p>

<p>But she was too pious and proper, it aggravated
him, but Ted never once laid a finger on her and
never uttered one word of reproach though he
despised her; never grudged her a thing in reason
when things were going well with him. It’s God
Almighty’s own true gospel—they never had a
quarrel in all the twelve years they was wed, and I
don’t believe they ever had an angry word, but how
he kept his hands off her I don’t know. I couldn’t
have done it, but I was never married—I was too
independent for that work. He’d contradict her
sometimes, for she <i>would</i> talk, and Ted was one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
your silent sorts, but <i>she</i>—she would talk for ever
more. She was so artful that she used to invent all
manners of tomfoolery on purpose to make him
contradict her; believe you, she did, even on his
death-bed.</p>

<p>I used to go and sit with him when he was going,
poor Ted, for I knew he was done for; and on the
day he died, she said to him—and I was there and I
heard it: “Is there anything you would like me to
do, dear?” And he said, “No.” He was almost
at his last gasp, he had strained his heart, but she was
for ever on at him, even then, an unresting woman.
It was in May, I remember it, a grand bright afternoon
outside, but the room itself was dreadful, it
didn’t seem to be afternoon at all; it was unbearable
for a strong man to be dying in such fine weather, and
the carts going by, and though we were a watching
him, it seemed more as if something was watching
us.</p>

<p>And she says to him again: “Isn’t there anything
you would like me to do?”</p>

<p>Ted says to her: “Ah! I’d like to hear you
give one downright good damn curse. Swear, my
dear!”</p>

<p>“At what?” she says.</p>

<p>“Me, if you like.”</p>

<p>“What for?” she says. I can see her now, staring
at him.</p>

<p>“For my sins.”</p>

<p>“What sins?” she says.</p>

<p>Now did you ever hear anything like that? What
sins! After a while she began at him once more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span></p>

<p>“Ted, if anything happens to you I’ll never marry
again.”</p>

<p>“Do what you like,” says he.</p>

<p>“I’ll not do that,” she says, and she put her arms
round him, “for you’d not rest quiet in your grave,
would you, Ted?”</p>

<p>“Leave me alone,” he says, for he was a very
crusty sick man, very crusty, poor Ted, but could you
wonder? “You leave me alone and I’ll rest sure
enough.”</p>

<p>“You can be certain,” she cries, “that I’d never,
never do that, I’d never look at another man after you,
Ted, never; I promise it solemnly.”</p>

<p>“Don’t bother me, don’t bother at all.” And
poor Ted give a grunt and turned over on his side
to get away from her.</p>

<p>At that moment some gruel boiled over on the hob—gruel
and brandy was all he could take. She
turned to look after it, and just then old Ted gave a
breath and was gone, dead. She turned like a flash,
with the steaming pot in her hand, bewildered for a
moment. She saw he had gone. Then she put the
pot back gently on the fender, walked over to the
window and pulled down the blind. Never dropped
a tear, not one tear.</p>

<p>Well, that was the end of Ted. We buried him,
one or two of us. There was an insurance on his life
for fifty pounds, but Ted had long before mortgaged
the policy and so there was next to nothing for her.
But what else could the man do? (Molly always
swore the bank defrauded her!) She put a death
notice in the paper, how he was dead, and the date,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
and what he died of: “after a long illness, nobly and
patiently borne.” Of course, that was sarcasm, she
never meant one word of it, for he was a terror to
nurse, the worst that ever was; a strong man on his
back is like a wasp in a bottle. But every year, when
the day comes round—and it’s ten years now since he
died—she puts a memorial notice in the same paper
about her loving faithful husband and the long illness
nobly and patiently borne!</p>

<p>And then, as I said, the insurance man and the
parson began to call again on that foolish woman, but
she would not alter her ways for any of them. Not
one bit. The things she had once enjoyed before her
marriage, the things she had wanted her own husband
to do but were all against his grain, these she could
nohow bring herself to do when he was dead and
gone and she was alone and free to do them. What a
farce human nature can be! There was an Italian
hawker came along with rings in his ears and a
coloured cart full of these little statues of Cupid, and
churches with spires a yard long and red glass in
them, and heads of some of the great people like the
Queen and General Gordon.</p>

<p>“Have you got a head of Lord Beaconsfield?”
Molly asks him.</p>

<p>He goes and searches in his cart and brings her
out a beautiful head on a stand, all white and new,
and charges her half a crown for it. Few days later
the parson calls on the job of persuading her to return
to his flock now that she was free to go once more.
But no. She says:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span> “I can never change now, sir, it
may be all wrong of me, but what my man thought
was good enough for me, and I somehow cling to
that. It’s all wrong, I suppose, and you can’t understand
it, sir, but it’s all my life.”</p>

<p>Well, Twamley chumbled over an argument or
two, but he couldn’t move her; there’s no mortal
man could ever more that woman except Ted—and
he didn’t give a damn.</p>

<p>“Well,” says parson, “I have hopes, Mrs. Wickham,
that you will come to see the matter in a new
light, a little later on perhaps. In fact, I’m sure you
will, for look, there’s that bust,” he says, and he
points to it on the mantelpiece. “I thought you and
he were all against Gladstone, but now you’ve got his
bust upon your shelf; it’s a new one, I see.”</p>

<p>“No, no, that isn’t Gladstone,” cried Molly, all
of a tremble, “that isn’t Gladstone, it’s Lord Beaconsfield!”</p>

<p>“Indeed, but pardon me, Mrs. Wickham, that is
certainly a bust of Mr. Gladstone.”</p>

<p>So it was. This Italian chap had deceived the
silly creature and palmed her off with any bust that
come handy, and it happened to be Gladstone. She
went white to the teeth, and gave a sort of scream,
and dashed the little bust in a hundred pieces on the
hearth in front of the minister there. O, he had a
very vexing time with her.</p>

<p>That was years ago. And then came the fire, and
then the bullseye shop. For ten years now I’ve
prayed that woman to marry me, and she just tells me:
No. She says she pledged her solemn word to Ted
as he lay a-dying that she would not wed again. It
was his last wish—she says. But it’s a lie, a lie, for I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
heard them both. Such a lie! She’s a mad woman,
but fond of him still in her way, I suppose. She liked
to see Ted make a fool of himself, liked him better so.
Perhaps that’s what she don’t see in me. And what
I see in her—I can’t imagine. But it’s a something,
something in her that sways me now just as it swayed
me then, and I doubt but it will sway me for ever.</p>

<h2 id="Tanil"><i>Tanil</i></h2>


<p>A Great while ago a man in a
stripéd jacket went travelling almost to the
verge of the world, and there he came upon a
region of green fertility, quiet sounds, and sharp
colour; save for one tiny green mound it was all
smooth and even, as level as the moon’s face, so flat
that you could see the sky rising up out of the end of
everything like a blue dim cliff. He passed into a
city very populous and powerful, and entered the shop
of a man who sold birds in traps of wicker, birds of
rare kinds, the flame-winged antillomeneus and kriffs
with green eyes.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said he to the hawker of birds, “this should
be a city of great occasions, it has the smell of
opulence. But it is all unknown to me, I have not
heard the story of its arts and policy, or of its people
and their governors. What annalists have you
recording all its magnificence and glory, or what
poets to tell if its record be just?”</p>

<p>The hawker of birds replied: “There are tales
and the tellers of tales.”</p>

<p>“I have not heard of these,” said the other, “tell
me, tell me.”</p>

<p>The bird man drew finger and thumb downwards
from the bridge of his long nose to its extremity, and
sliding the finger across his pliant nostrils said: “I
will tell you.” They both sat down upon a coffer of
wheat. “I will tell you,” repeated the bird man, and
he asked the other if he had heard of the tomb in
which none could lie, nor die, nor mortify.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span></p>

<p>“No,” said he.</p>

<p>“Or of the oracle that destroys its interpreter?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the man in the stripéd jacket,
and a talking bird in a cage screamed: “No, no,
no, no!” The traveller whistled caressingly to the
bird, tapping his finger nail along the rods of its
cage, while the bird man continued: “Or of Fax,
Mint, and Bombassor, the three faithful brothers?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied he again.</p>

<p>“They had a sister of beauty, of beauty indeed,
beyond imagination. (<i>Soo-eet! soo-eet!</i> chirped the
oracular bird.) It smote even the hearts of kings like
a reaping hook among grass, and her favour was a
ransom from death itself, as I will tell you.”</p>

<p>“Friend,” said he of the stripéd jacket, “tell me
of that woman.”</p>

<p>“I will tell you,” answered the other; and he told
him, and this was the way of it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was once a king of this country, mighty with
riches and homage, with tribute from his enemies—for
he was a great warrior—and the favour of many
excellent queens. His ancestors were numberless as
the hairs of his black beard; so ancient was his
lineage that he may have sprung from divinity itself,
but he had a heart of brass, his bowels were of lead,
and at times he was afflicted with madness.</p>

<p>One day he called for his captain of the guard,
Tanil, a valiant, debonair man of much courtesy, and
delivered to him his commands.</p>

<p>Tanil took a company of the guard and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
marched to that green hill on the plain—it is but a
league away. At the foot of the hill they crossed a
stream; beyond that was a white dwelling and a
garden; at the gate of the garden was a stumbling
stone; a flock grazed on the hill. The soldiers threw
down the stone and, coming into the vineyard, they
hacked down the vines until they heard a voice call
to them. They saw at the door of the white dwelling
a woman so beautiful that the weapons slid from their
hands at the wonder of it. “Friends, friends!” said
she. Tanil told her the King’s bidding, how they
must destroy the vineyard, the dwelling, and the
flock, and turn Fax, Mint, and Bombassor, with the
foster sister Flaune, out from the kingdom of Cumac.</p>

<p>“You have denied the King tribute,” said he.</p>

<p>“We are wanderers from the eastern world,”
Flaune answered. “Is not the mountain a free
mountain? Does not this stream divide it from
Cumac’s country?”</p>

<p>She took Tanil into the white dwelling and gave a
pitcher of wine to his men.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said she to Tanil, “I will go to your King.
Take me to your King.”</p>

<p>And when Tanil agreed to do this she sent a
message secretly to her brothers to drive the flock
away into a hiding-place. So while Flaune was gone
a-journeying to the palace with Tanil’s troup, Fax,
Mint, and Bombassor set back the stumbling stone
and took away the sheep.</p>

<p>The King was resting in his palace garden, throwing
crumbs into the lake, and beans to his peacocks,
but when Flaune was brought to him he rose and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
bowed himself to the pavement at her feet. The
woman said nothing, she walked to and fro before
him, and he was content to let his gaze rest upon her.
The carp under the fountain watched them, the rose
drooped on its envious briar, the heart of King Cumac
was like a tree full of chirping birds.</p>

<p>Tanil confessed his fault; might the King be
merciful and forgive him! but the lady had taken their
trespass with a soft temper and policy that had overcome
both his loyalty and his mind. It was unpardonable,
but it was not guilt, it was infirmity, she
had bewitched him. Cumac grinned and nodded.
He bade Tanil return to the vineyard and restore the
vines, bade him requite the brothers and confirm
them in those pastures for ever. But as to this Flaune
he would not let her go.</p>

<p>She paces before him, or she dips her palm into the
fountain, spilling its drops upon the ground; she
smiles and she is silent.</p>

<p>Cumac gave her into the care of his groom of the
women, Yali, the sister of Tanil, and thereafter, every
day and many a day, the King courted and coveted
Flaune. But he could not take her; her pride, her
cunning words, and her lustre bore her like an
anchored boat upon the tide of his purpose. At one
moment full of pride and gloom, and in the next full
of humility and love, he would bring gifts and praises.</p>

<p>“I will cover you,” he whispered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span> “with green
garnets and jargoons. A collar of onyx and ruby, that
is for you; breastknots of beryl, and rings for the
finger, wrist, and ear. Take them, take them! For
you I would tear the moon asunder.”</p>

<p>But all her desire was only to return to the green
mountain and her brothers and the flock by the
stumbling stone. The King was merged in anger
and in grief.</p>

<p>“Do not so,” he pleaded, “I have given freedom
to your men; will you not give freedom to me?”</p>

<p>“What freedom, Cumac?” she asked him.</p>

<p>And he said: “Love.”</p>

<p>“How may the bound give freedom?”</p>

<p>“With the gift of love.”</p>

<p>“The spirit of the gift lies only in the giver.” Her
voice was mournful and low.</p>

<p>He was confused and cast down. “You humble
me with words, but words are nothing, beautiful one.
Put on your collar of onyx, and fasten your breastknots
of beryl. Have I not griefs, fierce griefs, that
crash upon my brain, and frenzies that shoot in fire!
Does not your voice—that rest-recovering lure—allay
them, your presence numb them! I cannot let
you go, I cannot let you go.”</p>

<p>“He who woos and does not win,” so said Flaune,
“wins what he does not woo for.”</p>

<p>“Though I beg but a rose,” murmured the King,
“do you offer me a sword?”</p>

<p>“Time’s sword is laid at the breast of every rose.”</p>

<p>“But I am your lowly servant,” he cried. “You
have that which all secretly seek and denyingly long
for; it is seen without sight and affirmed without
speech.”</p>

<p>“What is the thing you seek and long for?”</p>

<p>“Purity,” said he.</p>

<p>“Purity!” She seemed to muse upon it as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
theme of mystery. “If you found purity, what
would you match it with?”</p>

<p>“My sins!” he cried again. “Would you waste
purity on purity, or mingle sin with sin?”</p>

<p>“Cumac,” said the wise woman, with no pride
then but only pity, “you seek to conquer that which
strikes the conqueror dead.”</p>

<p>Then, indeed, for a while he was mute, and then
for a while he talked of his sickness and his frenzy.
“Are there not charms,” he asked, “or magic herbs,
to find and bind these demons?”</p>

<p>There was no charm—she told him—but the
mind, and no magic but in the tranquillity of freedom.</p>

<p>“I do not know this,” he sighed, “it will never
be known.”</p>

<p>The unknown—she told him—was better than the
known.</p>

<p>“Alas, then,” sighed the King again, “I shall
never discover it.”</p>

<p>“It is everywhere,” said Flaune, “but it is like a
sweet herb that withers in the ground. All may
gather it—and it is not gathered. All may see it—and
it is not seen. All destroy it—and it never
dies....”</p>

<p>“Shall I be a little wind,” laughed Cumac, “and
gush among this grass?”</p>

<p>“It is the wind’s way among the roses. It has
horns of bright brass and quiet harps of silver. Its
golden boats flash in every tossing bay.”</p>

<p>Cumac laughed again, but still he would not let
her go.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span> “The fox has many tricks, the cat but one,”
he said, and caused her ankles to be fastened with two
jewelled links tied with a hopple of gold. But in a
day he struck them from her with his own hands, and
hung the hopple upon her lustrous neck.</p>

<p>And still he would not let her go; so Yali and
Tanil connived to send news to the brothers, and in a
little time Bombassor came to her aid.</p>

<p>Bombassor was a dancer without blemish, in
beauty or movement either. He came into the palace
to Cumac who did not know him, and the King’s
household came to the beaten gongs to witness the
art of Bombassor. Yali brought Flaune a harp of
ivory, and to its music Bombassor caracoled and
spun before the delighted King. Then Flaune (who
spoke as a stranger to him) asked Bombassor if he
would dance with her, and he said they would take
the dance of “The Flying Phœnix.” The King was
enchanted; he vowed he would grant any wish of
Bombassor’s, any wish; yes, he would cut the moon
in half did he desire it. “I will dance for your
pledge,” said Bombassor.</p>

<p>It seemed to the King then as if a little whirling
wind made of flame, and a music that was perfume,
gyred and rose before him: the tapped gongs, the
tinkle of harp, the surprise of Flaune’s swaying and
reeling, now coy, now passionate, the lure of her
wooing arms, the rhythm of her flying feet, the
chanting of the onlookers, and the flashing buoyance
of Bombassor, so thrilled and distracted him that he
shouted like an eager boy.</p>

<p>But when Bombassor desired Cumac to give him
the maiden Flaune, the King was astonished.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span> “No,
no,” he said, “but give him an urn full of diamonds,”
and Bombassor was given an urn full of diamonds.
He let it fall at the King’s feet, and the gems clattered
upon the pavement like a heap of peas. “Give him
Yali, then,” Cumac shouted. Yali was a nymph of
splendour, but Bombassor called aloud, “No, a
pledge is a pledge!”</p>

<p>Then the King’s joy went from him and, like a
star falling, left darkness and terror.</p>

<p>“Take,” he cried, “an axe to his head and pitch it
to the crows.”</p>

<p>And so was Bombassor destroyed, while the King
continued ignorantly to woo his sister. Silent and
proud was she, silent and proud, but her beauty began
to droop until Yali and Tanil, perceiving this, connived
again to send to her brothers, and in a little
time Mint came. To race on foot he was fleeter than
any of Cumac’s champions; they strove with him,
but he was like the unreturning wind, and although
they cunningly moved the bounds of the course, and
threw thorns and rocks under his feet, he defeated
them all, and the King jeered at his own champions.
Then Mint called for an antelope to be set in the
midst of the plain and cried: “Who will catch this
for the King?” All were amazed and Cumac said:
“Whoever will do it I will give him whatever a King
may give, though I crack the moon for it.”</p>

<p>The men let go the hind and it swooped away,
Mint pursuing. Fast and far they sped until no
man’s gaze could discern them, but in a while Mint
returned bearing the breathing hind upon his back.
“Take off his shoes,” cried the King,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span> “and fill them
with gold.” But when this was done Mint spilled
the gold back at the King’s feet.</p>

<p>“Give me,” said he, “this maiden Flaune.”</p>

<p>The King grinned and refused him.</p>

<p>“Was it not in the bond?” asked Mint.</p>

<p>“Ay,” replied Cumac, “but choose again.”</p>

<p>“Is this then a King’s bond?” sneered Mint.</p>

<p>“It was a living bond,” said the King, “but death
can sever it. Let this dog be riven in sunder and his
bowels spilled to the foxes.” Mint died on the
moment, and Cumac continued ignorantly to woo his
sister.</p>

<p>Then Flaune conferred with Tanil and with Yali
about a means of escape. Tanil feared to be about
this, but he loved Flaune, and his sister Yali persuaded
him. He showed them a great door in the back of the
palace, a concealed issue through the city wall, from
which Flaune might go in a darkness could but the
door be opened. But it had not been opened for a
hundred years, and they feared the hinges would
shriek and the wards grind in the lock and so discover
them.</p>

<p>“Let us bring oil to-morrow,” they said, “and
oil it.”</p>

<p>In the morning they brought oil to the hinge and
brushed it with drops from a cock’s feather. The
hinge gave up its squeak but yet it groaned. They
filled Yali’s thimble that was made of tortoise horn
and poured this upon it. The hinge gave up its groan
but yet it sighed. They filled the eggshell of a goose
with oil and poured upon the hinge until it was silent.
Then they turned to the lock, which, as they threw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
back the wards, cried clack, clack. Tanil lapped the
great key with ointment, but still the lock clattered.
He filled his mouth with oil and spat into the hole,
but still it clinked. Then Flaune caught a grasshopper
which she dipped in oil and cast into the lock.
After that the lock was silent too.</p>

<p>On the mid of night Tanil ushered Flaune to the
great door, and it opened in peace. She said “Farewell”
to him tenderly, and vanished away into the
darkness, and so to the green mountain. As he
stooped, watching her until his eyes could see no
more, the door suddenly closed and locked against
him, leaving him outside the wall. Lights came, and
an outcry and a voice roaring: “Tanil is fled with
the King’s mistress. Turn out the guard.” Tanil
knew it to be the voice of a jealous captain, and, filled
with consternation, he too turned and fled away into
the night; not towards the mountains, but to the sea,
hoping to catch a ship that would deliver him.</p>

<p>Throughout the night he was going, striving or
sleeping, and it was stark noon before he came to the
shore and passed over the strait in a ship conveying
merchants to a fair where no one knew him and all
were friendly. He hobnobbed with the merchants
for several days, feeding and sleeping in the booths
until the morning of the sixth day, and on that day
a crier came into the fair ringing and bawling, bawling
and ringing, and what he cried was this:</p>

<p>That King Cumac, Lord of the Forty Kingdoms,
Prince of the Moon, and Chieftain under God, laid a
ban upon all who should aid or relieve his treacherous
servant Tanil, who had conspired against the King<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
and fled. Furthermore it was to be known that Yali,
the sister of Tanil, was taken as hostage for him, that
if he failed to redeem her and deliver up his own body
Yali herself was doomed to perish at sunset of the
seventh day after his flight.</p>

<p>Tanil scarcely waited to hear the conclusion, for he
had but one day more and he could suffer not his
sister Yali to die. He turned from the fair and ran to
the sea. As he ran he slipped upon a rock and was
stunned, but a good wife restored him and soon he
reached the harbour. Here none of the sailors
would convey him over the strait, for they were
bound to the merchantmen who intended not to sail
that day. Having so little time to reckon Tanil
offered them bribes (but in vain), and threats (but
they would not), and he was in torment and anguish
until he came to an old man who said he would take
him within the hour if the wind held and the tide
turned. But if the wind failed, although the tide
should ebb never so kindly, yet he would not go:
and even should the tide ebb strongly, yet if the wind
wavered from its quarter he would not go: and if by
mysterious caprice (for all was in the hands of God
and a great wonder) the tide itself should not turn,
then the wind might blow a dainty squall but he
would not be able to undertake him. Upon this they
agreed, and Tanil and the old sailor sat down in the
little ship to play at checkers. Alas, fortune was
against Tanil, he could not conquer the sailor, so he
made to pay down his loss.</p>

<p>“Friend,” said the sailor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span> “a game is but a game,
put up your purse.”</p>

<p>Tanil would not put back the money and the sailor
said: “Let us then play on, friend; double or quits.”
They played on, and again Tanil lost, and, as before,
tendered his money. “Nay,” said the sailor, “a
game is but a pastime, put back your money.” But
Tanil laid it in a heap upon one of the thwarts.
The old sailor sighed and said: “Come, you are now
at the turn of fortune; is not an egg made of water
and a stone of fire: let us play once more; double or
quits.” And so continually, until it was long past
noon ere they began to sail in a course for Cumac’s
shore, two leagues over the strait. Now they had
accomplished about three parts of this voyage when
the wind slackened away like a wisp of smoke;
slowly they drifted onwards until at eve the boat lay
becalmed, and as yet some way out from the land.
“Friend,” said the old sailor, laying out the checkers
again, “let us tempt the winds of fortune.” But,
full of grief at having squandered the precious hours,
Tanil leaped into the sea and swam towards the shore.
Soon the tide checked and was changed, and a current
washed him far down the strait until the fading of
day; then he was cast upon a crooking cape of sand
in such darkness of night and such weariness of mind
and body that he could not rise. He lay there for a
while consumed with languor and hunger until the
peace refreshed him; the winds of night were lulled
and the waves; but though there were stars in the
sky they could not guide him.</p>

<p>“Alas,” he groaned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span> “darkness and the oddness
of the coast deceive me. Whether I venture to the
right hand or the left, how shall I make my way?
How little is man’s power; the fox and the hare may
wander deceitfully but undeterred, yet here in this
darkness I go groping like a worm laid upon a rock.
Yali, my sister, how shall I preserve you?”</p>

<p>He went wandering across a hill away from the sea
until he stumbled upon a hurdle and fell; and where
he fell he lay still, sleeping.</p>

<p>Not until the dawn did Tanil wake; then he lay
shivering in bonds, with a company of sheep watchers
that stood by and mocked at him. Their shadows
were long, a hundred-fold, for day was but newly
dawned.</p>

<p>Their master was not yet risen from his bed, but
the watchers carried Tanil to the door of his house
and called to him.</p>

<p>“Master, we have caught a robber of the flock,
lying by the fold and feigning sleep.”</p>

<p>Now the sleepy master lay with a new bride, and
he would not stir.</p>

<p>“Come, master, we have taken a robber,” they
cried again. And still he did not move, but the bride
rose and came to the window.</p>

<p>“What sheep has he stole?”</p>

<p>They answered her: “None, for we swaddled
him; behold!”</p>

<p>She looked down at Tanil with her pleasant eyes,
and bade the men unbind him.</p>

<p>“Who guards now the sheep from robbers and
wolves?” she called. They were all silent, and some
made to go off. She bade them mend their ways, and
went back to her lover. When the thongs were
loosened from Tanil he begged them to give him a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
little food for he was empty and weak, but they
scolded him and went hastily away. Their shadows
were long, a hundred-fold.</p>

<p>Tanil travelled on wings. Yali was to die at fall
of night. He hastened like a lover, but sickness and
hunger overcame him; at noon he lay down in a cool
cavern to recover. No other travellers came by him
and no homes were near, for he was passing across the
fringe of a desert to shorten his journey, and the highway
crooked round far to the eastward. Nothing that
man could eat was there to sustain him, but he slept.
When he rose his legs weakened and he limped
onwards like a slow beggar whose life lies all behind
him. Again he sank down, again he could not keep
from sleeping. The sun was setting when he awoke,
the coloured towers of his city shone only a league
away. Then in his heart despair leaped and maddened
him—Yali had died while he tarried.</p>

<p>Searching through a thicket for some place where
he could hang himself he came upon a river, and saw,
close to the shore, a small ship standing slowly down
towards the straits from which he had come. Under
her slack sail a man was playing on a pipe; with him
was a monkey gazing sorrowfully from the deck at
the great glow in the sky.</p>

<p>“Shipman,” cried Tanil, “will you give me bread,
I am at an end?”</p>

<p>The man with a smile of malice held up from the
deck a dish of fruits and said: “Take. I have done.”</p>

<p>But the hungry man could not reach it. “Throw
it to me,” he cried, following the ship. But the sailor
had no mind to throw it upon the shore; he went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
leaning against his mast, piping an air, while the
monkey peered at him and gabbled. Tanil plunged
into the river and swam beneath the ship’s keel.
Taking a knife from his girdle he was for mounting
by a little hawser, but the man beflogged him with
a cudgel until he fell back into the water. There he
would have died but that a large barque presently
catched him up on board and recovered him.</p>

<p>The ship carried Tanil from the river past the
straits and so to the great sea, where for the space of a
year he was borne in absence, willy-nilly, while the
ship voyaged among the archipelagos, coasted grim
seaboards, or lay against strange wharves docking her
cargo of oil. Faithfully he laboured for wages under
this ship’s captain, being a man of pith and limb,
valiant in storm, and enamoured of the uncouth
work: the haul of anchor, and men singing; setting,
reefing, furling, and men singing; the watch, the
sleep, the song; the treading of unknown waters,
the crying gust, the change to glassy endless calm,
and the change again from green day to black night
and the bending of the harsh sheet in a starry squall,
the crumpling of far thunder, the rattle of halyard and
block, the howl of cordage. Grand it was in some
bright tempest to watch the lubber wave slide greenly
to the bows and crack in showers of flying diamonds,
but best of all was the long crunch in from the vast
gulfs, and the wafture to some blue bay sighing below
a white dock and the homes of men.</p>

<p>Forgotten was Yali his loved sister, but that proud
living Flaune who had brought Yali to her death, she
was not forgotten. He sailed the seas and he sailed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
the seas, but she was ever a soft recalling wonder in his
breast, the sound of a bell of glass beaten by a spirit.</p>

<p>After a year of hazards the ship by chance docked
in that harbour where Tanil had heard the crier
crying of Yali and her doom. Looking about him he
espied an old sailor sitting in his boat playing a game
of checkers with a young man. The crier bawled in
the market place, but he had no news for Tanil.
Standing again amid the merchants and the kind
coloured sweetness of streets and people, this bliss of
home so welled up in his breast that he hastened back
to the ship. “Master,” he said, “give me my wages,
and let me go.” The shipman gave him his wages,
and he went back to the town.</p>

<p>But only nine days did he linger there, for joy,
like truth, lives in the bottom of a well, and he cast
in his wages. Then he went off with a hunter to trap
leopards in a forest. A month they were gone, and
they trapped the leopards and sold them, and then,
having parted from the hunter, Tanil roved back to
the port to spend his gains among the women of the
town. Often his soul invited him to return to that
city of Cumac, but death awaited him there and he
did not go. Now he was come to poverty, but he was
blithe, and evil could not chain him. “Surely,” said
Tanil, “life is a hope unquenched and a tree of
longing. There is none so poor but he can love
himself.” With a stolen net he used to catch fish and
live. Then he lost the net at dicing. So he went to
bake loaves for certain scholars, but they were unmonied
men and he desisted, and went wandering
from village to village snaring birds, or living like the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
wild dogs, until a friendly warrior enlisted him to
convoy a caravan across the desert to the great lakes.
When he came again to the harbour town two years
had withered since he had flown from Cumac’s city.</p>

<p>He went to lodge at the inn, and as he paced in the
evening along the wharf a man accosted him, called
him by name, and would not let him go, and then
Tanil knew it was Fax, the brother of that Flaune.
His heart rocked in his breast when he took Fax to
the inn and related all his adventure. “Tell me the
tidings of our city, what comes or goes there, what
lives or dies.” And Fax replied: “I have wandered
in the world searching after you from that time. I
bring a greeting from my sister Flaune,” he said,
“and from your sister Yali, my beloved.”</p>

<p>The wonder then, the joy and shame of Tanil,
cannot be told: he threw himself down and wept, and
begged Fax to tell him of the miracle: “For,” said
he, “my mind has misused me in this.”</p>

<p>“Know then,” proceeded Fax,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span> “that after the
unlocking of the door my sister flees in darkness to
the green mountain. I go watching and lurking, and
learn that the King is in jealous madness, for your
enemy spreads a slander and Cumac is deceived. He
believes that my sister’s love has been cozened by
you. Yali is caught fast in his net. My heart
quivers in fear of his bloody intent, and I say to
Flaune: ‘What shall follow if Tanil return not?’
And she smiles and says ever: ‘He will return.’
And again I say: ‘He tarries. What if he be dead?’
And she smiles and says ever: ‘He is not dead.’
But you come not, your steps are turned from us, no
one has seen you, you are like a hare that has fallen
into a pit, and you do not come. Then in that last
hour Flaune goes to Cumac. He raves of deceit and
treachery. ‘It is my sin,’ my sister pleads, ‘the
blame is mine. Spare but this Yali and I will wash
out the blame.’ ’Ay, you will wash it out with
words!‘ ’I will pay the debt in kind,’ says my sister
Flaune, ‘if Tanil does not return.’ But the cunning
King will not yield up Yali unless my sister yield in
love to him. So thus it stands even now, but whether
they live in peace and love I do not know. I only
know that Yali lives and serves her in the palace
there. But they wait, and I too wait. Now the
thread is ravelled to its end; I have lived only to seek
you. My flock is lost, perished; my vineyard fades,
but I came seeking.”</p>

<p>“Brother,” cried Tanil in grief, “all shall be as
before. Yali shall rest in your bosom.”</p>

<p>At dawn then they sailed over the straits and landed,
and having bargained with a wine carrier for two
asses they rode off in the direction of the city. Tanil’s
heart was filled with joy and love, his voice carolled,
his mind hummed like a homing bee. “Surely,” he
said, “life is a hope unquenched, a tree of longing.
It yields its branches into a little world of summer.
The asp and the dragon appear, but the tree buds, the
enriching bough cherishes its leaves, and, lo, the
fruit hangs.”</p>

<p>But the heart of Fax was very grave within him.
“For,” thought he,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span> “this man will surely die. Yet
I would rather this than lose the love of Yali, and
though they slay him I will bring him there.”</p>

<p>So they rode along upon the asses, and a great bird
on high followed them and hovered on its wings.</p>

<p>“What bird is that?” asked the one. And the
other, screening his eyes and peering upwards, said:</p>

<p>“A vulture.”</p>

<p>When King Cumac heard that they were come he
ordered them to be bound, and they were bound, and
the guard clustered around them. Tanil saw that his
enemy was now captain of the men, and that the King
was sour and distraught.</p>

<p>“You come!” cried Cumac, “why do you
come?”</p>

<p>They told him it was to redeem the bond and make
quittance.</p>

<p>“Bonds and quittances! What bond can lie
between a King and faithless subjects?”</p>

<p>Said Fax: “It lies between the King and my sister
Flaune.”</p>

<p>“How if I kill you both?”</p>

<p>“The bond will hold,” said Fax.</p>

<p>“Come, is a bond everlasting then, shall nothing
break it?”</p>

<p>“Neither everlasting, nor to be broken.”</p>

<p>“What then?”</p>

<p>“It shall be fulfilled.”</p>

<p>“Can nothing amend it?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said Fax.</p>

<p>“Nothing? Nothing? Fools!” laughed the
King, “the woman is happy, and desires not to leave
me!”</p>

<p>Tanil stood bowed in silence and shame, and
Cumac turned upon him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span> “What says this rude
passionate beast!” The King’s anger rose like a
blast among oaks. “Has he no talk of bonds, this
toad that crawled into my heart and drank my living
blood? Has he nothing to restore? or gives he and
takes he at the will of the wind?”</p>

<p>“I have a life to give,” said Tanil.</p>

<p>“To give! You have a life to lose!”</p>

<p>“Take it, Cumac,” said he.</p>

<p>The King sprang up and seized Tanil by the beard,
rocking him, and shouting through his gritting teeth:
“Ay, bonds should be kept—should they not?—in
truth and trust—should they not?”</p>

<p>Then he flung from him and went wailing in
misery, swinging his hands, and raging to and fro,
up and down.</p>

<p>“Did she not come to me, come to me? Was it
not agreed? Bonds and again bonds! Yet when I
woo her she denies me still. O, honesty in petticoats
is a saint with a devil’s claw. The bitter virginal
thing turned her wild heart to this piece of cloven
honour. Bonds, more bonds! Spare me these supple
bonds! O, you spread cunning nets, but what fowler
ever thrived in his own snare? Did she not come to
me? Was it not agreed?”</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped and made a sign through a
casement. “Is all ready?”</p>

<p>“Ay,” cried a voice.</p>

<p>“Now I will make an end,” said King Cumac.
“Prop them against the casements.” They carried
Tanil to a casement on his right hand, and Fax to a
casement on his left hand. Tanil saw Flaune standing
in the palace garden amid a troop of Ethiopians,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
each with a green turban and red shoes and a tunic
coloured like a stone, but she half-clad with only black
pantaloons, and her long dark locks flowing. And
Fax saw Yali in fetters amid another troop of black
soldiers.</p>

<p>Again a sigh from the King; two great swords
flashed, and Tanil, at one casement, saw the head
of Flaune turn over backwards and topple to the
ground, her body falling after with a great swathe
of shorn tresses floating over it. Fax at the other
casement saw Yali die, screaming a long cry that
it seemed would never end. Tanil swayed at the
casement.</p>

<p>Then Cumac turned with a moan of grief, his
madness all gone. “The bond is ended. I have
done. I say I have done.” He seemed to wake as
from sleep, and, seeing the two captive men, he
asked: “Why did they come? What brought them
here? Take them away, the bond is ended, I say I
have done. There shall be no more bonds given in
the world. But take them out of the city gate and
unbind them and cast them both loose; then clap fast
the gate again. No more death, I would not have
them die; let them wander in the live world, and dog
each other for ever. Tanil, you rotten core of
constancy, Fax brought you here and so Flaune,
bitter and beautiful, dies. But Fax still lives—do
you not see him?—I give Fax to you: may he die
daily for ever. Fax, blundering jackal, you spoke of
bonds. The bond is met, and so Yali is dead, but
Tanil still lives: I give you Tanil as an offering, but
not of peace. May he die daily for ever.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span></p>

<p>So the guard took Fax and Tamil out of the city,
struck off their shackles, and left them there together.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The bird man finished; there was a silence; the
other yawned. “Did you hear this?” asked the
bird man. And the man in the stripéd jacket replied:
“Ay, with both ears, and so may God bless you.”
So saying, he rose and went out singing.</p>

<p>“Henry Turley was one of
those awkward old chaps as had more money
than he knowed what to do wi'. Shadrach
we called him, the silly man. He had worked for it,
worked hard for it, but when he was old he stuck to
his fortune and wouldn’t spend a sixpence of it on
his comforts. What a silly man!”</p>

<p>The thatcher, who was thus talking of Henry
Turley (long since dead and gone) in the “Black
Cat” of Starncombe, was himself perhaps fifty years
old. Already there was a crank of age or of dampness
or of mere custom in most of his limbs, but he was
bluff and gruff and hale enough, with a bluffness of
manner that could only offend a fool—and fools never
listened to him.</p>

<p>“Shadrach—that’s what we called him—was a
good man wi’ cattle, a masterpiece; he would strip
a cow as clean as a tooth and you never knowed a cow
have a bad quarter as Henry Turley ever milked.
And when he was buried he was buried with all that
money in his coffin, holding it in his hand, I reckon.
He had plenty of relations—you wouldn’t know ’em,
it is thirty years ago I be speaking of—but it was all
down in black and white so’s no one could touch it.
A lot of people in these parts had a right to some of it,
Jim Scarrott for one, and Issy Hawker a bit, Mrs.
Keelson, poor woman, ought to have had a bit, and
his own brother, Mark Turley; but he left it in the
will as all his fortune was to be buried in the coffin
along of him. ’Twas cruel, but so it is and so it will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
be, for whenever such people has a shilling to give
away they goes and claps it on some fat pig’s haunches.
The foolishness! Sixty pounds it was, in a canister,
and he held it in his hand.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe a word of it,” said a mild-faced
man sitting in the corner. “Henry Turley never did
a deed like that.”</p>

<p>“What?” growled the thatcher with unusual
ferocity.</p>

<p>“Coorse I’m not disputing what you’re saying,
but he never did such a thing in his life.”</p>

<p>“Then you calls me a liar?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. O no, don’t misunderstand me,
but Henry Turley never did any such thing, I can’t
believe it of him.”</p>

<p>“Huh! I be telling you facts, and facts be true
one way or another. Now you waunts to call over me,
you waunts to know the rights of everything and the
wrongs of nothing.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the mild-faced man, pushing his
pot toward the teller of tales, “I might believe it
to-morrow, but it’s a bit of a twister now, this
minute!”</p>

<p>“Ah, that’s all right then”—the thatcher was
completely mollified. “Well the worst part of the
case was his brother Mark. Shadrach served him
shameful, treated him like a dog. (Good health!)
Ah, like a dog. Mark was older nor him, about
seventy, and he lived by himself in a little house out
by the hanging pust, not much of a cottage, it warn’t—just
wattle and daub wi’ a thetch o’ straa'—but the
lease was running out <span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>(‘twas a lifehold affair) and
unless he bought this little house for fifty pound he’d
got to go out of it. Well, old Mark hadn’t got no
fifty pounds, he was ate up wi’ rheumatics and only
did just a little light labour in the woods, they might
as well a’ asked him for the King’s crown, so he said
to his master: Would he lend him the fifty pounds?</p>

<p>“‘No, I can’t do that,’ his master says.</p>

<p>“‘You can reduct it from my wages,’ Mark says.</p>

<p>“‘Nor I can’t do that neither,’ says his master,
‘but there’s your brother Henry, he’s worth a power
o’ money, ask him.‘ So Mark asks Shadrach to lend
him the fifty pounds, so’s he could buy this little
house. ’No,’ says Henry, ‘I can’t.’ Nor he
wouldn’t. Well—old Mark says to him: ‘I doan
wish you no harm Henry,’ he says, ‘but I hope as how
you’ll die in a ditch.’ (Good health!) And sure
enough he did. That was his own brother, he were
strooken wi’ the sun and died in a ditch, Henry did,
and when he was buried his fortune was buried with
him, in a little canister, holding it in his hand, I
reckons. And a lot of good that was to him! He
hadn’t been buried a month when two bad parties
putt their heads together. Levi Carter, one was, he
was the sexton, a man that was half a loony as I
always thought. O yes, he had got all his wits about
him, somewheres, only they didn’t often get much of
a quorum, still he got them—somewheres. T’other
was a chap by the name of Impey, lived in Slack the
shoemaker’s house down by the old traveller’s garden.
He wasn’t much of a mucher, helped in the fieldwork
and did shepherding at odd times. And these two
chaps made up their minds to goo and collar Henry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
Turley’s fortune out of his coffin one night and share
it between theirselves. ’Twas crime, ye know,
might a been prison for life, but this Impey was a bad
lot—he’d the manners of a pig, pooh! filthy!—and I
expects he persuaded old Levi on to do it. Bad as
body-snatchen, coorse ’twas!</p>

<p>“So they goos together one dark night, ’long in
November it was, and well you knows, all of you, as
well as I, that nobody can’t ever see over our churchyard
wall by day let alone on a dark night. You all
knows that, don’t you?” asserted the thatcher, who
appeared to lay some stress upon this point in his
narrative. There were murmurs of acquiescence by
all except the mild-faced man, and the thatcher
continued: “‘Twere about nine o’clock when they
dug out the earth. ’Twarn’t a very hard job, for
Henry was only just a little way down. He was buried
on top of his old woman, and she was on top of her
two daughters. But when they got down to the
coffin Impey didn’t much care for that part of the
job, he felt a little bit sick, so he gives the hammer and
the screwdriver to Levi and he says: ’Levi,’ he says,
‘are you game to make a good job o’ this?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, I be,’ says old Levi.</p>

<p>“‘Well, then,’ Impey says, ‘yous’ll have my
smock on now while I just creeps off to old Wannaker’s
sheep and collars one of they fat lambs over by the
'lotments.’</p>

<p>“‘You’re not going to leave me here,’ says Carter,
‘what be I going to do?’</p>

<p>“‘You go on and finish this ’ere job, Levi,’ he
says,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span> ‘you get the money and put back all the earth
and don’t stir out of the yard afore I comes or I’ll
have yer blood.’</p>

<p>“‘No,’ says Carter, ‘you maun do that.’</p>

<p>“‘I ’ull do that,’ Impey says, ‘he’ve got some
smartish lambs I can tell ’ee, fat as snails.’</p>

<p>“‘No,’ says Carter, ‘I waun’t have no truck wi’
that, tain’t right.’</p>

<p>“‘You will,’ says Impey, ‘and I ’ull get the sheep.
Here’s my smock. I’ll meet ’ee here again in ten
minutes. I’ll have that lamb if I ’as to cut his
blasted head off.’ And he rooshed away before Levi
could stop him. So Carter putts on the smock and
finishes the job. He got the money and putt the
earth back on poor Henry and tidied it up, and then
he went and sat in the church poorch waiting for this
Impey to come back. Just as he did that an oldish
man passed by the gate. He was coming to this
very place for a drop o’ drink and he sees old Levi’s
white figure sitting in the church poorch and it
frittened him so that he took to his heels and tore
along to this very room we be sittin’ in now—only
'twas thirty years ago.</p>

<p>“‘What in the name of God’s the matter wi’
you?‘ they says to him, for he’d a face like chalk
and his lips was blue as a whetstone. ’Have you
seen a goost?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ he says, ‘I have seen a goost, just now
then.’</p>

<p>“‘A goost?’ they says, ‘a goost? You an’t
seen no goost.’</p>

<p>“‘I seen a goost.’</p>

<p>“‘Where a’ you seen a goost?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span></p>

<p>“So he telled ’em he seen a goost sitting up in the
church poorch.</p>

<p>“‘I shan’t have that,’ says old Mark Turley, for
he was a setting here.</p>

<p>“‘I tell you ’twas then,’ says the man.</p>

<p>“‘Can’t be nothing worse’n I be myself,’ Mark
says.</p>

<p>“‘I say as ’tis,’ the man said, and he was vexed too.
‘Goo and see for yourself.’</p>

<p>“‘I would goo too and all,’ said old Mark, ‘if
only I could walk it, but my rheumatucks be that
scrematious I can’t walk it. Goosts! There’s ne’er a
mortal man as ever see’d a goost. I’d go, my lad, if my
legs ’ud stand it.’ And there was a lot of talk like
that until a young sailor spoke up—Irish he was, his
name was Pat Crowe, he was on furlough. I dunno
what he was a-doing in this part of the world, but
there he was and he says to Mark: ‘If you be game
enough, I be, and I’ll carry you up to the churchyard
on my back.’ A great stropping feller he was. ‘You
will?’ says Mark. ‘That I will,’ he says. ‘Well I
be game for ’ee,’ says Mark, and so they ups him on
to the sailor’s shoulders like a sack o’ corn and away
they goos, but not another one there was man enough
to goo with them.</p>

<p>“They went slogging up to the churchyard gate
all right, but when they got to staggering along ’tween
the gravestones Mark thought he could see a something
white sitting in the poorch, but the sailor
couldn’t see anything at all with that lump on his
shoulders.</p>

<p>“‘What’s that there?’ Mark whispers in Pa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>t’s
ear. And Pat Crowe whispers back, just for joking:
‘Old Nick in his nightshirt.’</p>

<p>“‘Steady now,’ Mark whispers, ‘go steady Pat,
it’s getting up and coming.’ Pat only gives a bit of a
chuckle and says: ‘Ah, that’s him, that’s just like
him.’</p>

<p>“Then Levi calls out from the poorch soft like:
‘You got him then! Is he a fat ’un?’</p>

<p>“‘Holy God,’ cried the sailor, ‘it <i>is</i> the devil!’
and he chucks poor Mark over his back at Levi’s
feet and runs for his mortal life. He was the most
frittened of the lot ’cos he hadn’t believed in anything
at all—but there it was. And just as he gets to the
gate he sees someone else coming along in the dark
carrying a something on its shoulder—it was Impey
wi’ the sheep. ‘Powers above,’ cried Pat Crowe,
‘it’s the Day of Judgment come for sartin!’ And he
went roaring the news up street like a madman, and
Impey went off somewheres too—but I dunno where
Impey went.</p>

<p>“Well, poor old Mark laid on the ground, he
were a game old cock, but he could hardly speak, he
was strook dazzled. And Levi was frittened out of
his life in the darkness and couldn’t make anythink
out of nothink. He just creeps along to Mark and
whispers: ‘Who be that? Who be that?’ And
old Mark looks up very timid, for he thought his
last hour was on him, and he says: ‘Be that you,
Satan?’ Drackly Levi heard that all in a onexpected
voice he jumped quicker en my neighbour’s flea.
He gave a yell bigger nor Pat Crowe and he bolted
too. But as he went he dropped the little tin canister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
and old Mark picked it up. And he shook the
canister, and he heerd money in it, and then something
began to dawn on him, for he knowed how his
brother’s fortune had been buried.</p>

<p>“‘I rede it, I rede it,’ he says, ‘that was Levi
Carter, the dirty thief! I rede it, I rede it,’ he says.
And he putt the tin can in his pocket and hopped off
home as if he never knowed what rheumatucks was
at all. And when he opened that canister there was
the sixty golden sovereigns in that canister. Sixty
golden sovereigns! ‘Bad things ’ull be worse afore
they’re better,’ says Mark, ‘but they never won’t
be any better than this.’ And so he stuck to the
money in the canister, and that’s how he bought his
cottage arter all. ’Twarn’t much of a house, just
wattle and daub, wi’ a thetch o’ straa', but ’twas what
he fancied, and there he ended his days like an old
Christian man. (Good health!)”</p>

<h2 id="Huxley_Rustem"><i>Huxley Rustem</i></h2>


<p>Huxley Rustem settled himself
patiently upon the hairdresser’s waiting
bench to probe the speculation that jumped
grasshopper-like into the field of his inquisitorial
mind: ’Why does a man become a barber? Well,
what <i>is</i> it that persuades a man, not by the mere
compulsion of destiny, but by the sweet reasonableness
of inclination, to dedicate his activities to the
excision of other people’s pimples and the discomfiture
of their hairy growths? He had glanced
through the two papers, <i>Punch</i> and <i>John Bull</i>,
handed him by the boy in buttons, and now, awaiting
his turn, posed himself with this inquiry. There
was a girl at it, too, at the end of the saloon. She
seemed to have picked him out from the crowd of
men there; he caught her staring, an attractive girl.
It seemed insoluble; misfortunate people may, indeed
must, by the pressure of circumstances, become
sewermen, butchers, scavengers, and even clergymen,
but the impulse to barbery was, he felt, quite
indelicately ironic. How that girl stared at him—if
she was not very careful she would be clipping
the fellow’s ear—did she think she knew him?
He rather hoped she would have to attend to him;
would he be lucky enough? Huxley tried to estimate
the chances by observing the half-dozen toilets in
progress, but his calculations did not encourage the
hope at all. It was very charming for an agreeable
woman, a stranger, too, to do that kind of service
for you. He remembered that, after his marriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
five years ago, he had tried to persuade his wife to
lather and shave him, “just for a lark, you know,”
but she was adamant, didn’t see the joke at all! Well,
well, he decided that the word barber derived in some
ironic way from the words barbarism or barbarity,
expressing, unconsciously perhaps, contempt on the
part of the barber for a world that could only offer
him this imposture for a man’s sacred will to order
and activity. Yet it didn’t seem so bad for women—that
splendid young creature there at the end of the
saloon! The boy in buttons approached, and Huxley
Rustem was ushered to that vacant chair at the end;
the splendid young thing had placed a wrapper about
him—she had almost “cuddled” it round his neck—and
stood demurely preparing to do execution upon
his poll, turning her eyes mischievously upon his
bright-hued socks, which, by a notable coincidence,
were the same colour as her own handsome hose.
Huxley had a feeling that she had cunningly arranged
the succession of turns in order to secure him to her
chair—which shows that he was still young and very
impressionable. Such a feeling is one of the customary
assumptions of vanity, the natural and prized, but
much-denied, possession of all agreeable people.
Huxley, as the girl had already noted, and now saw
more vividly in the mirror fronting them, <i>was</i> agreeable,
was attractive. (My dear reader, both you and
Huxley Rustem are right, the dainty barbaress <i>had</i>
laid her nets for this particular victim.)</p>

<p>“How would you like it cut, sir?” she asked,
placing a hand upon each of his shoulders, and peering
round at him with enamouring eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span></p>

<p>“Oh, with a pair of scissors, don’t you think?”
he replied at a venture, for he was not often waggish.
But it was a very successful sally, the girl chuckled
with rapture, loose fringes of her hair tickled his
cheek, and he caught puffs of her sweet-scented
breath. She was gold-haired, not very tall, and had
pleasant turns about her neck and face and wrists that
almost fascinated him. When they had agreed upon
the range and extent of his shearing, the girl proceeded
to the accomplishment of the task in complete
silence, almost with gravity. Huxley began wondering
how many hundreds and thousands of crops were
squeezed annually by the delicious fingers, how many
polls denuded by those competent shears. Very sad.
Once a year, he supposed, she would go holidaying
for a week or ten days; she would go to Bournemouth
for the bathing or for whatever purpose it is
people go to Bournemouth, Barmouth, or Blackpool.
He determined to come in again the day after to-morrow
and be shaved by her.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the rite she brushed his coat
collar very meticulously, tiptoeing a little, and
remarked in a bright manner upon the weather, which
was also bright. Then she went back to shave what
Huxley described to himself as a “red-faced old
cockalorum,” whom he at once disliked very thoroughly.
She had given him a check with a fee
marked upon it; he took this down the stairs and paid
his dues to “a bald-headed old god-like monster”—Huxley
felt sure he was—who sat in the shop below,
surrounded by fringe-nets, stuffings, moustache
wax, creams, toothbrushes, and sponges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span></p>

<p>Two days later Huxley Rustem repeated his visit,
but not all the intrigue of the girl nor his own manœuvring
could effect the happy arrangement again,
although he sat for a long time feeling sure that there
was no other establishment of its kind in which the
elements of celerity were so unreservedly abandoned,
and the flunkeyism so peculiarly viscous. The
many mirrors, of course, multiplied the objects of his
factitious contempt; those male barbers were small
vain beings of disagreeable outline to whom the doom
of shaving tens of thousands of chins for ever and ever
afforded a white-faced languid happiness. Huxley
was exasperated—his personality always ran so easily
to exasperation—by the care with which the wrinkled
face of a sportive old gent of sixty was being massaged
with steaming cloths. He wore pretty brown button
boots and large check trousers; there was still a
vain wisp or two of white hair left upon his tight
round skull and his indescribably silly old face. In
the outcome our hero had perforce to be shaved by a
youth of the last revolting assiduity, who caressed his
chin with strong, excoriating palms.</p>

<p>In the ensuing weeks Huxley Rustem became a
regular visitor to the saloon, but he suffered repeated
disappointments. He was disconsolate; it was most
baffling; not once did he secure the bliss of her
attentions. He felt himself a fool; some men could
do these things as easily as they grew whiskers, but
Rustem was not one of them, for the traditions of
virtue and sweet conduct were very firmly rooted in
him; he was like a mouse living in a large white
empty bath which, if it was unscaleable, was clean,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
and if it was rather blank was never terrifying. It is
easy, so very easy, to be virtuous when you can’t be
anything else. But still he very much desired to take
the fair barber out to dinner, say, just for an hour or
two in a quiet place where one eats and chats and
listens to the pleasant shrilling of restaurant violins.
He would be able to amuse her with tales and recitals
of his experiences and she would constantly exclaim
“Really!” as if entranced—as she probably would
be. In his imagined hour her conversational exchanges
never developed beyond that, yet it was
enough to thrill him with a mild happiness. An
egoist is a mystic without a god, but seldom ever
without a goddess. It was bliss to adore her, but
very heaven for her to be adoring him. To be just
to Huxley Rustem that was all he meant, but try as he
would he could never make up the happy occasion.
It was a most discomfiting experience. It is true that
he saw her in the street on three or four occasions,
but each time he was accompanied by his wife, and
each time he was guilty of a vain pretence, his
behaviour to his companion being extremely casual—as
if she were just an acquaintance instead of being
an important alliance. But no one could possibly
have mistaken the lady for anything but Huxley’s
very own wife, and the little barber was provocatively
demure at these encounters. Once, however, he was
alone, and she passed, ogling him in a very frank way.
But she did not understand egoists like Rustem. He
was impervious to any such direct challenge; he
thought it a little silly, coarse even. Had she been
shy and diffident, allowing him to be masterful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
instead of confusing him, he would have fluttered
easily into her flame.</p>

<p>So the affair remained, and would have remained
for ever but that, by the grace of fortune, he found
himself one day at last actually sitting again in front
of the charming girl, who was not less aware of the
attraction than he himself. She was nervous and
actually with her shears clipped a part of his ear.
Huxley was rather glad of that, it eased the situation,
but on his departure he committed the rash act for
which he never afterwards forgave himself. Her
fingers were touching his as she gave him the pay
check, when he took suddenly from his pocket a
silver coin and pressed it into her hand, smiling. It
was as if he had struck her a blow. He was shocked
at the surprised resentment in the fierce glance she
flung him. She tossed the coin into a tray for catching
tobacco ash and cigarette ends. He realized at
once the enormity of the affront; his vulgar act had
smashed the delicate little coil between them. Vague
and almost frivolous as it was, she had prized it.
Poor as it was, it could yet deeply humiliate him.
But it was a blunder that could never be retrieved,
and he turned quickly and sadly out of the saloon,
feeling the awful sting of his own contempt. Crass
fool that he was, didn’t he realize that even barbers
had their altitudes? Did he think he could buy a
jewel like that, as he bought a packet of tobacco, with
a miserable shilling? Perhaps Huxley Rustem was
unduly sensitive about it, but he could never again
bring himself to enter the saloon and meet that
wounded gaze. He only recovered his balance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
when, a fortnight later, he encountered her in the
street wearing the weeds of a widow! Then he
felt almost as indignant as if she had indeed deceived
him!</p>

<h2 id="Big_Game"><i>Big Game</i></h2>


<p>Old Squance was the undertaker,
but in the balmy, healthy, equable air of
Tamborough undertaking was not a thriving
trade; its opportunities were but an ornamental
adjunct to his more vital occupation of builder. Even
so those old splendid stone-built cottages never
needed repairs, or if they did Squance didn’t do
them. Storms wouldn’t visit Tamborough, fires
didn’t occur, the hand of decay was, if anything, more
deliberate than the hand of time itself, and no newcomer,
loving the old houses so much, ever wanted
to build a new one: so Mrs. Squance had to sell
hard-looking bullseyes and stiff-looking fruit in a
hard, stiff-looking shop. Also knitting needles and,
in their time of the year, garden seeds. Squance was
a meek person whom you would never have credited
with heroic tendencies; nevertheless, with no more
romantic background than a coffin or two, a score
of scaffold poles, and sundry hods and shovels, he
had acquired in a queer, but still not unusual, way
the repute of a lion-slayer. Mrs. Squance was not
so meek, she was not meek at all, she was ambitious—but
vainly so. Her ambitions secured their fulfilment
only in her nocturnal dreams, but in that
sphere they were indeed triumphant and she was
satisfied. The most frequent setting of her unconscious
imagination happened to be a tiny modern
flat in which she and old Ben seemed to be living in
harmony and luxury. It was a delightful flat, very
high up—that was the proper situation for a flat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
mind you, just under the roof—with stairs curling
down, and down, and down till it made you giddy to
think of them. The kitchen, well, really Mrs.
Squance could expatiate endlessly on that and the
tiny corner place with two wash-basins in it and room
enough to install a bath if you went in for that kind
of thing. Best of all was the sitting-room in front,
looking into a street so very far below that Mrs.
Squance declared she felt as if she had been sitting
in a balloon. Here Mrs. Squance, so she dreamed,
would sit and browse. She didn’t have to look at
ordinary things like trees and mud and other people’s
windows. That was what made it so nice, Mrs.
Squance declared. She had instead a vista of roofs
and chimneys, beautiful telephone standards, and
clouds. The people, too, who walked far down
beneath were always unrecognizable; a multitude of
hat crowns seemed to collect her gaze, linked with
queer movements, right, left, right, left, of knees and
boots, though sometimes she would be lucky enough
to observe a very fat man, just a glimpse perhaps of
his watch-guard lying like a chain of oceanic islands
across a scholastic globe. In the way of dreams she
knew the street by the name of Lather Lane. It was
cobbled with granite setts. There was a barber’s
shop at one corner and a depot for foreign potatoes
and bananas at another. That flat was so constantly
the subject of her dream visitations that she came to
invest it with a romantic reality, to regard it as an
ultimate real possession lying fortuitously somewhere,
at no very great remove, in some quarter she might
actually, any day now, luckily stumble across.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span></p>

<p>And it was in that very flat she beheld Mr.
Squance’s heroism. It seemed to be morning in her
dream, early; it must have been early. She and
Squance were at breakfast when what should walk
deliberately and astoundingly into the room but a
lion. Mrs. Squance, never having seen a lion before,
took it to be a sheepdog, and she shouted, “Go out,
you dirty thing!” waving a threatening hand towards
it. But the animal did not go out; it pranced up to
Mrs. Squance in a genial way, seized her admonishing
hand and playfully tried to bite it off. Really! Mr.
Squance had risen to his startled feet shouting “Lion!
lion!” and then Mrs. Squance realized that she had
to contend with a monster that kept swelling bigger
and bigger before her very eyes, until it seemed that
it would never be able to go out of that door again.
It had a tremendous head and mane, with whiskers
on its snout as stiff as knitting needles, and claws like
tenpenny nails; but its tail was the awfullest thing,
long and very flexible, with a bush of hair at the end
just like a mop, which it wagged about, smashing all
sorts of things.</p>

<p>“Ben,” said Mrs. Squance, “'ave you a pistol?”</p>

<p>“No, I ’ave not,” said Ben.</p>

<p>“Then we’re done,” she had declared. “Oh, no,
we ain’t, though! You ’old ’im, Ben, and I’ll go and
get a pistol; ’old ’im!”</p>

<p>Ben valiantly seized the lion by its mane and tail,
but it did not care for such treatment; it began to
snarl and swish about the room, dragging poor Ben
as if he had been just a piece of rabbit pie.</p>

<p>“'Old ’im! ’old ’im!” exhorted Mrs. Squance, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
she popped on her bonnet and shawl. “You ’old
'im!”</p>

<p>“All right,” breathed Ben, as she ran off and began
the descent of the long narrow staircase. Almost at
the bottom she met a piano coming upwards. It
was not a very large piano, but it was large enough to
prevent her from descending any further. It was
resting upon the backs of two men, one in front,
whose entirely bald, perspiring, projecting head
reminded her of the head of a tortoise, and one who
followed him unseen. They crawled on all fours,
while the piano was balanced by a man who pulled
it in front and another who pushed it from behind.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” exclaimed Mrs. Squance. “I ’ope
you won’t be long.”</p>

<p>They made no reply; the piano continued to
advance, the bald man swaying his head still more
like a tortoise. She began to retire before them, and
continued retiring step by step until she became
irritated and demanded to know the owner of that
piano. The men seemed to be dumb, so she skipped
up to the second floor to make enquiries, knocking at
the first door with her left hand—the right one still
hurting her very much. It was exasperating. Someone
had just painted and varnished the doors, and
she was compelled to tap very lightly instead of
giving the big bang the occasion required. Consequently
no one heard her, while her hand became
covered with a glutinous evil liquid. She ran up to
the third floor. Here the doors were all right, but
although she set up a vigorous cannonade again no
one heard her, at least, no one replied except some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
gruff voice that kept repeating “Gone, no address!
Gone, no address!” She opened the doors, but there
seemed to be no one about, although each room had
every appearance of recent occupation: fires alight,
breakfast things recently used, and in the bedrooms
the disordered beds. She was now extremely
annoyed. She opened all the doors quickly until she
came to the last room, which was occupied by the
old clergyman who kept ducks there and fed them on
macaroni cheese. It was just as she feared; the
ducks were waiting, they flocked quacking upon the
passage and stairs before she could prevent them.</p>

<p>“I’m sure,” screamed Mrs. Squance, in her
dreadful rage, “it’s that lion responsible for all this!”</p>

<p>She wasted no more time upon the matter. She
rapidly descended the stairs again, treading upon
innumerable indignant ducks, until she came to the
piano. Here she said not a word, but, brushing the
leading man aside, placed her foot roughly upon the
slippery head of the first crawling man and scrambled
over the top of the instrument, jumping thence upon
the back part of the hindmost man, who turned his
feet comically inwards, and wore round his loins a
belt as large as the belly-band of a waggon horse.</p>

<p>She proceeded breathlessly until she came to the
last flight, where, behold! the stairs had all been
smashed in by those awkward pianists, and she stood
on the dreadful verge of a drop into a cellar full of
darkness and disgusting smells. But she was able
to leap upon the banister-rail which was intact, and
slide splendidly to the ground floor. An unusual
sight awaited her. Mrs. Squance did not remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
ever to have seen such a thing before, but there in the
hall a marvellous eustacia tree was growing out of the
floor. She was not surprised at the presence of a
tree in that unwonted situation. She had not
noticed it before, but it did not seem out of place.
Why shouldn’t trees grow where they liked? They
always did. Mrs. Squance invariably took life as she
found it, even in dreams. While she was surveying
the beautiful proportions of the eustacia tree, the
richness of its leaves, and its fine aroma a small bird,
without warning or apology, alighted upon her right
hand—which she carried against her chest as if it
were in a sling, though it wasn’t—and laid an egg on
it. It <i>was</i> so annoying, she did not know what to do
with it; she was afraid of smashing it. She rushed
from the building, and entered the butcher’s shop a
few doors away. The shop was crowded with
customers, and the butcher perspired and joked with
geniality, as is the immemorial custom with butchers.
His boy, a mere tot of five or six years of age, observed
to Mrs. Squance that it was “a lovely day, ma’am,”
and she replied that it was splendid. So it was.
People were buying the most extraordinarily fleshly
fare, the smelt of an ox, a rib of suet, a fillet of liver,
and one little girl purchased nineteen lambs’ tongues,
which she took away secretly in a portmanteau.</p>

<p>“Now Mrs. Squance, what can I do for you?”
enquired the butcher. Without comment she handed
him the egg of the bird. He cast it into the till as if it
were a crown piece. “And the next thing, ma’am?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span></p>
<p>“'Ave you got such a thing as a pistol, Mr.
Verryspice?”</p>

<p>Mr. Verryspice had, he had got two, and drawing
them from the belt wherefrom dangled his sharpener,
he laid two remarkable pieces of ordnance before
her. In her renewed agitation she would have
snatched up one of the pistols, but Mr. Verryspice
prevented her.</p>

<p>“No, no, ma’am, I shall have to get permission
for you to use it first.”</p>

<p>“But I really must ’ave it immediate....”</p>

<p>“Yes?” said the butcher.</p>

<p>“ ... for my husband.”</p>

<p>“I see,” he replied sympathetically. “Well,
come along then and I’ll get an interim permission
at once.” Seizing a tall silk hat from its hook and
placing it firmly upon his head he led her from his
establishment.</p>

<p>“Singular that the trams are all so full this morning,”
commented Mrs. Squance as they awaited a
conveyance.</p>

<p>“Most unusual, ma’am,” replied Mr. Verryspice.
But at last they persuaded a bathchair man to give
them a lift to their destination, where they arrived a
little indecorously perhaps, for the top-hatted butcher
was sitting as unconcernedly and as upright as a wax
figure upon Mrs. Squance’s knees. The office they
sought lay somewhere in a vast cavernous building
full of stairs and corridors, long, exhausting, hollow
corridors like the Underground railway, and on
every floor and turning were signposts of the turnpike
variety with directions:</p>

<p>“To the Bedel of St. Thomas’s Basket, 3 miles.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span></p>
<p>“Registrar of Numismatics and Obligations, 2-1/4.”</p>

<p>Along one of these passages they plunged, and
after some aggravating hindrances, including a
demand from a humpty-backed clerk for a packet of
No. 19 egg-eyed sharps, and five pennyworth of
cachous which she found in her bosom, the permission
was secured, and the butcher thereupon
handed the weapon to Mrs. Squance.</p>

<p>“What did you say you wanted it for?” he asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Squance’s gratitude was great, but her
indignation was deep and disdained reply. She
seized the pistol and began to run home. Rather a
stout lady, too, and the exercise embarrassed her.
Her hair fetched loose, her stockings slipped down,
and her strange, hurrying figure, brandishing a
pistol, soon attracted the notice of policemen and a
certain young greengrocer with a tray of onions, who
trotted in her wake until she threatened them all with
the firearm.</p>

<p>Breathlessly at last she mounted the tremendous
staircase. Happily in the interval the damage had
been repaired, the tree chopped down, piano delivered,
and ducks recaptured. She reached her rooms only
in time to hear a great crash of glass from within.
Old Ben was strutting about with a triumphant air.</p>

<p>“I done ’im—I done ’im,” he called. “You can
come in now; I’ve just chucked ’im through the
window!” And sure enough he had. The sash
looked as if it had been blown out by a cannon-ball.
Mrs. Squance peered out, and there, far down at the
front door, curled up as if asleep, lay the lion. At
that moment the milkman arrived, with that dissonant
clatter peculiar to milkmen. He dashed down his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
cans close by the nose of the lion, which apparently he
had not seen. The scared animal leaped up in its
terror, and darting down an alley was seen no more.</p>

<p>So far this narrative, devoid as it is of moral grandeur
and literary grace, has subjected the reader’s
comprehension to no scientific rigours; but he who
reads on will discern its cunning import—a psychological
outcome with the profoundest implications.
Listen. Mrs. Squance awoke that morning in her
own hard-looking little house of one floor, with the
hard-looking shop, startled to find the window of their
room actually smashed, and inexplicable pains in her
right hand. She related these circumstances in after
years with so many symptoms of truth and propriety
that she herself at last vividly believed in the figure
of old Ben as a lion-slayer. “Saved my life when I
was ’tacked by a lion!” she would say to her awed
grandchildren, and she would proceed to regale them
with a narration which, I regret to say, had only the
remotest likeness to the foregoing story.</p>

<p>One of the commonest sights in
the vale was a certain man on a bicycle carrying
a bag full of newspapers. He was as much
a sound as a sight, for what distinguished him from
all other men to be encountered there on bicycles was
not his appearance, though that was noticeable; it
was his sweet tenor voice, heard as he rode along
singing each morning from Cobbs Mill, through
Kezzal Predy Peter, Thasper, and Buzzlebury, and
so on to Trinkel and Nuncton. All sorts of things he
sang, ballads, chanties, bits of glees, airs from operas,
hymns, and sacred anthems—he was leader of Thasper
church choir—but he seemed to observe some
sort of rotation in their rendering. In the forepart of
the week it was hymns and anthems; on Wednesday
he usually turned to modestly secular tunes; he was
rolling on Thursday and Friday through a gamut of
love songs and ballads undoubtedly secular and not
necessarily modest, while on Saturday—particularly
at eve, spent in the tap of “The White Hart”—his
programme was entirely ribald and often a little
improper. But always on Sunday he was the most
decorous of men, no questionable liquor passed his
lips, and his comportment was a credit to the church,
a model even for soberer men.</p>

<p>Dan Pavey was about thirty-five years old, of
medium height and of medium appearance except
as to his hat (a hard black bowler which seemed never
to belong to him, though he had worn it for years)
and as to his nose. It was an ugly nose, big as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
baby’s elbow; he had been born thus, it had not
been broken or maltreated, though it might have
engaged in some pre-natal conflict when it was
malleable, since when nature had healed, but had not
restored it. But there was ever a soft smile that
covered his ugliness, which made it genial and said,
or seemed to say: Don’t make a fool of me, I am a
friendly man, this is really my hat, and as for my
nose—God made it so.</p>

<p>The six hamlets which he supplied with newspapers
lie along the Icknield Vale close under the
ridge of woody hills, and the inhabitants adjacent to
the woods fell the beech timber and, in their own
homes, turn it into rungs or stretchers for chair
manufacturers who, somewhere out of sight beyond
the hills, endlessly make chair, and nothing but chair.
Sometimes in a wood itself there may be seen a shanty
built of faggots in which sits a man turning pieces of
chair on a treadle lathe. Tall, hollow, and greenly
dim are the woods, very solemn places, and they
survey the six little towns as a man might look at six
tiny pebbles lying on a green rug at his feet.</p>

<p>One August morning the newspaper man was
riding back to Thasper. The day was sparkling like
a diamond, but he was not singing, he was thinking
of Scroope, the new rector of Thasper parish, and
the thought of Scroope annoyed him. It was not
only the tone of the sermon he had preached on
Sunday, “The poor we have always with us,” though
that was in bad taste from a man reputed rich and
with a heart—people said—as hard as a door-knocker;
it was something more vital, a congenital difference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
between them as profound as it was disagreeable.
The Rev. Faudel Scroope was wealthy, he seemed to
have complete confidence in his ability to remain so,
and he was the kind of man with whom Dan Pavey
would never be able to agree. As for Mrs. Scroope,
gloom pattered upon him in a strong sighing shower
at the least thought of her.</p>

<p>At Larkspur Lane he came suddenly upon the
rector talking to an oldish man, Eli Bond, who was
hacking away at a hedge. Scroope never wore a hat,
he had a curly bush of dull hair. Though his face
was shaven clean it remained a regular plantation of
ridges and wrinkles; there was a stoop in his shoulders,
a lurch in his gait, and he had a voice that howled.</p>

<p>“Just a moment, Pavey,” he bellowed, and Dan
dismounted.</p>

<p>“All those years,” the parson went on talking to
the hedger; “all those years, dear me!”</p>

<p>“I were born in Thasper sixty-six year ago, come
the twenty-third of October, sir, the same day—but
two years before—as Lady Hesseltine eloped with
Rudolf Moxley. I was reared here and I worked
here sin’ I were six year old. Twalve children I have
had (though five on ’em come to naught and two be
in the army) and I never knowed what was to be
out of work for one single day in all that sixty year.
Never. I can’t thank my blessed master enough
for it.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that splendidly feudal,” murmured the
priest, “who is your good master?”</p>

<p>The old man solemnly touched his hat and said:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
“God.”</p>

<p>“O, I see, yes, yes,” cried the Rev. Scroope.
“Well, good health and constant, and good work
and plenty of it, are glorious things. The man who
has never done a day’s work is a dog, and the man
who deceives his master is a dog too.”</p>

<p>“I never donn that, sir.”</p>

<p>“And you’ve had happy days in Thasper, I’m
sure?”</p>

<p>“Right-a-many, sir.”</p>

<p>“Splendid. Well ... um ... what a heavy rain we
had in the night.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that <i>was</i> heavy! At five o’clock this morning
I daren’t let my ducks out—they’d a bin drownded,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Ha, now, now, now!” warbled the rector as he
turned away with Dan.</p>

<p>“Capital old fellow, happy and contented. I wish
there were more of the same breed. I wish....”
The parson sighed pleasantly as he and Dan walked
on together until they came to the village street
where swallows were darting and flashing very low.
A small boy stood about, trying to catch them in his
hands as they swooped close to him. Dan’s own dog
pranced up to his master for a greeting. It was black,
somewhat like a greyhound, but stouter. Its tail
curled right over its back and it was cocky as a
bird, for it was young; it could fight like a tiger
and run like the wind—many a hare had had proof
of that.</p>

<p>Said Mr. Scroope, eyeing the dog: “Is there
much poaching goes on here?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span></p>
<p>“Poaching, sir?”</p>

<p>“I am told there is. I hope it isn’t true for I have
rented most of the shooting myself.”</p>

<p>“I never heard tell of it, sir. Years ago, maybe.
The Buzzlebury chaps one time were rare hands at
taking a few birds, so I’ve heard, but I shouldn’t
think there’s an onlicensed gun for miles around.”</p>

<p>“I’m not thinking so much of guns. Farmer
Prescott had his warren netted by someone last week
and lost fifty or sixty rabbits. There’s scarcely a hare
to be seen, and I find wires wherever I go. It’s a
crime like anything else, you know,” Scroope’s voice
was loud and strident, “and I shall deal very severely
with poaching of any kind. O yes, you have to, you
know, Pavey. O yes. There was a man in my last
parish was a poacher, cunning scoundrel of the worst
type, never did a stroke of work, and <i>he</i> had a dog,
it wasn’t unlike your dog—this <i>is</i> your dog, isn’t it?
You haven’t got your name on its collar, you should
have your name on a dog’s collar—well, he had a
perfect brute of a dog, carried off my pheasants by
the dozen; as for hares, he exterminated them. Man
never did anything else, but we laid him by the heels
and in the end I shot the dog myself.”</p>

<p>“Shot it?” said Dan. “No, I couldn’t tell a
poacher if I was to see one. I know no more about
'em than a bone in the earth.”</p>

<p>“We shall be,” continued Scroope, “very severe
with them. Let me see—are you singing the Purcell
on Sunday evening?“</p>

<p>”<i>He Shall Feed His Flock</i>—sir—<i>like a Shepherd</i>.”</p>

<p>“Splendid! <i>Good</i>-day, Pavey.”</p>

<p>Dan, followed by his bounding, barking dog,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
pedalled home to a little cottage that seemed to sag
under the burden of its own thatch; it had eaves a
yard wide, and birds’ nests in the roof at least ten
years old. Here Dan lived with his mother, Meg
Pavey, for he had never married. She kept an absurd
little shop for the sale of sweets, vinegar, boot buttons
and such things, and was a very excellent old dame,
but as naïve as she was vague. If you went in to her
counter for a newspaper and banged down a halfcrown
she would as likely as not give you change for
sixpence—until you mentioned the discrepancy,
when she would smilingly give you back your halfcrown
again.</p>

<p>Dan passed into the back room where Meg was
preparing dinner, threw off his bag, and sat down
without speaking. His mother was making a heavy
succession of journeys between the table and a
larder.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Scroope’s been here,” said Meg, bringing
a loaf to the table.</p>

<p>“What did <i>she</i> want?”</p>

<p>“She wanted to reprimand me.”</p>

<p>“And what have <i>you</i> been doing?”</p>

<p>Meg was in the larder again. “’Tis not me, ’tis
you.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, mother?”</p>

<p>“She’s been a-hinting,” here Meg pushed a dish
of potatoes to the right of the bread, and a salt-cellar
to the left of the yawning remains of a rabbit pie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
“about your not being a teetotal. She says the
boozing do give the choir a bad name and I was to
persuade you to give it up.”</p>

<p>“I should like to persuade her it was time she is
dead. I don’t go for to take any pattern from that
rich trash. Are we the grass under their feet? And
can you tell me why parsons’ wives are always so
much more awful than the parsons themselves?
I never shall understand that if I lives a thousand
years. Name o’ God, what next?”</p>

<p>“Well, ’tis as she says. Drink is no good to any
man, and she can’t say as I ain’t reprimanded
you.”</p>

<p>“Name o’ God,” he replied, “do you think I
booze just for the sake o’ the booze, because I like
booze? No man does that. He drinks so that he
shan’t be thought a fool, or rank himself better than
his mates—though he knows in his heart he might
be if he weren’t so poor or so timid. Not that one
would mind to be poor if it warn’t preached to him
that he must be contented. How can the poor be
contented as long as there’s the rich to serve? The
rich we have always with <i>us</i>, that’s <i>our</i> responsibility,
we are the grass under their feet. Why should we
be proud of that? When a man’s poor the only
thing left him is hope—for something better: and
that’s called envy. If you don’t like your riches you
can always give it up, but poverty you can’t desert,
nor it won’t desert you.”</p>

<p>“It’s no good flying in the face of everything like
that, Dan, it’s folly.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span></p>
<p>“If I had my way I’d be an independent man and
live by myself a hundred miles from anywheres or
anybody. But that’s madness, that’s madness, the
world don’t expect you to go on like that, so I do as
other folks do, not because I want to, but because I
a’nt the pluck to be different. You taught me a good
deal, mother, but you never taught me courage and
I wasn’t born with any, so I drinks with a lot of fools
who drink with me for much the same reason, I
expect. It’s the same with other things besides
drink.”</p>

<p>His indignation lasted throughout the afternoon
as he sat in the shed in his yard turning out his usual
quantity of chair. He sang not one note, he but
muttered and mumbled over all his anger. Towards
evening he recovered his amiability and began to
sing with a gusto that astonished even his mother.
He went out into the dusk humming like a bee,
taking his dog with him. In the morning the Rev.
Scroope found a dead hare tied by the neck to his
own door-knocker, and at night (it being Saturday)
Dan Pavey was merrier than ever in “The White
Hart.” If he was not drunk he was what Thasper
calls “tightish,” and had never before sung so many
of those ribald songs (mostly of his own composition)
for which he was noted.</p>

<p>A few evenings later Dan attended a meeting of the
Church Men’s Guild. A group of very mute countrymen
sat in the village hall and were goaded into
speech by the rector.</p>

<p>“Thasper,” declared Mr. Scroope, “has a great
name for its singing. All over the six hamlets there
is surprising musical genius. There’s the Buzzlebury
band—it is a capital band.”</p>

<p>“It is that,” interrupted a maroon-faced butcher
from Buzzlebury,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span> “it can play as well at nine o’clock
in the morning as it can at nine o’clock at night, and
that’s a good band as can do it.”</p>

<p>“Now I want our choir to compete at the county
musical festival next year. Thasper is going to show
those highly trained choristers what a native choir
is capable of. Yes, and I’m sure our friend Pavey
can win the tenor solo competition. Let us all put
our backs into it and work agreeably and consistently.
Those are the two main springs of good human conduct—consistency
and agreeability. The consistent
man will always attain his legitimate ends, always.
I remember a man in my last parish, Tom Turkem,
known and loved throughout the county; he was not
only the best cricketer in our village, he was the best
for miles around. He revelled in cricket, and cricket
only; he played cricket and lived for cricket. The
years went on and he got old, but he never dreamed
of giving up cricket. His bowling average got larger
every year and his batting average got smaller, but he
still went on, consistent as ever. His order of going
in dropped down to No. 6 and he seldom bowled;
then he got down to No. 8 and never bowled. For a
season or two the once famous Tom Turkem was
really the last man in! After that he became umpire,
then scorer, and then he died. He had got a little
money, very little, just enough to live comfortably on.
No, he never married. He was a very happy, hearty,
hale old man. So you see? Now there is a cricket
club at Buzzlebury, and one at Trinkel. Why not a
cricket club at Thasper? Shall we do that?...
Good!”</p>

<p>The parson went on outlining his projects, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
although it was plain to Dan that the Rev. Scroope
had very little, if any, compassion for the weaknesses
natural to mortal flesh, and attached an extravagant
value to the virtues of decency, sobriety, consistency,
and, above all, loyalty to all sorts of incomprehensible
notions, yet his intentions were undeniably agreeable
and the Guild was consistently grateful.</p>

<p>“One thing, Pavey,” said Scroope when the meeting
had dispersed, “one thing I will not tolerate in
this parish, and that is gambling.”</p>

<p>“Gambling? I have never gambled in my life,
sir. I couldn’t tell you hardly the difference between
spades and clubs.”</p>

<p>“I am speaking of horse-racing, Pavey.”</p>

<p>“Now that’s a thing I never see in my life, Mr.
Scroope.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you need not go to the races to bet on horses;
the slips of paper and money can be collected by men
who are agents for racing bookmakers. And that is
going on all round the six hamlets, and the man who
does the collecting, even if he does not bet himself, is
a social and moral danger, he is a criminal, he is
against the law. Whoever he is,” said the vicar,
moderating his voice, but confidently beaming and
patting Dan’s shoulder, “I shall stamp him out
mercilessly. <i>Good</i>-night, Pavey.”</p>

<p>Dan went away with murder in his heart. Timid
strangers here and there had fancied that a man with
such a misshapen face would be capable of committing
a crime, not a mere peccadillo—you wouldn’t
take notice of that, of course—but a solid substantial
misdemeanour like murder. And it was true, he <i>was</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
capable of murder—just as everybody else is, or
ought to be. But he was also capable of curbing that
distressing tendency in the usual way, and in point
of fact he never did commit a murder.</p>

<p>These rectorial denunciations troubled the air but
momentarily, and he still sang gaily and beautifully
on his daily ride from Cobbs Mill along the little
roads to Trinkel and Nuncton. The hanging richness
of the long woods yellowing on the fringe of
autumn, the long solemn hills themselves, cold sunlight,
coloured berries in briary loops, the brown
small leaves of hawthorn that had begun to drop from
the hedge and flutter in the road like dying moths,
teams of horses sturdily ploughing, sheepfolds
already thatched into little nooks where the ewes
could lie—Dan said—as warm as a pudding: these
things filled him with tiny ecstasies too incoherent
for him to transcribe—he could only sing.</p>

<p>On Bonfire Night the lads of the village lit a great
fire on the space opposite “The White Hart.” Snow
was falling; it was not freezing weather, but the snow
lay in a soft thin mat upon the road. Dan was returning
on his bicycle from a long journey and the light
from the bonfire was cheering. It lit up the courtyard
of the inn genially and curiously, for the
recumbent hart upon the balcony had a pad of snow
upon its wooden nose, which somehow made it look
like a camel, in spite of the huddled snow on its
back which gave it the resemblance of a sheep. A
few boys stood with bemused wrinkled faces before
the roaring warmth. Dan dismounted very carefully
opposite the blaze, for a tiny boy rode on the back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
of the bicycle, wrapped up and tied to the frame by a
long scarf; very small, very silent, about five years
old. A red wool wrap was bound round his head and
ears and chin, and a green scarf encircled his neck
and waist, almost hiding his jacket; gaiters of grey
wool were drawn up over his knickerbockers. Dan
lifted him down and stood him in the road, but he was
so cumbered with clothing that he could scarcely
walk. He was shy; he may have thought it ridiculous;
he moved a few paces and turned to stare at his
footmarks in the snow.</p>

<p>“Cold?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>The child shook its head solemnly at him and then
put one hand in Dan’s and gazed at the fire that was
bringing a brightness into the longlashed dark eyes
and tenderly flushing the pale face.</p>

<p>“Hungry?”</p>

<p>The child did not reply. It only silently smiled
when the boys brought him a lighted stick from the
faggots. Dan caught him up into his arms and
pushed the cycle across the way into his own home.</p>

<p>Plump Meg had just shredded up two or three red
cabbages and rammed them into a crock with a
shower of peppercorns and some terrible knots of
ginger. There was a bright fire and a sharp odour of
vinegar—always some strange pleasant smell in Meg
Pavey’s home—she had covered the top of the crock
with a shield of brown paper, pinioned that with
string, licked a label: “Cabege Novenbr 5t,” and
smoothed it on the crock, when the latch lifted and
Dan carried in his little tiny boy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span></p>
<p>“Here he is, mother.”</p>

<p>Where Dan stood him, there the child remained;
he did not seem to see Mother Pavey, his glance had
happened to fall on the big crock with the white
label—and he kept it there.</p>

<p>“Whoever’s that?” asked the astonished Meg
with her arms akimbo as Dan began to unwrap the
child.</p>

<p>“That’s mine,” said her son, brushing a few
flakes of snow from the curls on its forehead.</p>

<p>“Yours! How long have it been yours?”</p>

<p>“Since ’twas born. No, let him alone, I’ll undo
him, he’s full up wi’ pins and hooks. I’ll undo him.”</p>

<p>Meg stood apart while Dan unravelled his offspring.</p>

<p>“But it is not your child, surely, Dan?”</p>

<p>“Ay, I’ve brought him home for keeps, mother.
He can sleep wi’ me.”</p>

<p>“Who’s its mother?”</p>

<p>“’Tis no matter about that. Dan Cupid did it.”</p>

<p>“You’re making a mock of me. Who is his
mother? Where is she? You’re fooling, Dan,
you’re fooling!”</p>

<p>“I’m making no mock of anyone. There, there’s
a bonny grandson for you!”</p>

<p>Meg gathered the child into her arms, peering into
its face, perhaps to find some answer to the riddle,
perhaps to divine a familiar likeness. But there was
nothing in its soft smooth features that at all resembled
her rugged Dan’s.</p>

<p>“Who are you? What’s your little name?”</p>

<p>The child whispered: “Martin.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span></p>
<p>“It’s a pretty, pretty thing, Dan.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said her son, “that’s his mother. We
were rare fond of each other—once. Now she’s
wedd’n another chap and I’ve took the boy, for it’s
best that way. He’s five year old. Don’t ask me
about her, it’s <i>our</i> secret and always has been. It was
a good secret and a grand secret, and it was well kept.
That’s her ring.”</p>

<p>The child’s thumb had a ring upon it, a golden
ring with a small green stone. The thumb was
crooked, and he clasped the ring safely.</p>

<p>For a while Meg asked no more questions about
the child. She pressed it tenderly to her bosom.</p>

<p>But the long-kept secret, as Dan soon discovered,
began to bristle with complications. The boy was
his, of course it was his—he seemed to rejoice in his
paternity of the quiet, pretty, illegitimate creature.
As if that brazen turpitude was not enough to confound
him he was taken a week later in the act of
receiving betting commissions and heavily fined in the
police court, although it was quite true that he himself
did not bet, and was merely a collecting agent for a
bookmaker who remained discreetly in the background
and who promptly paid his fine.</p>

<p>There was naturally a great racket in the vestry
about these things—there is no more rhadamanthine
formation than that which can mount the ornamental
forehead of a deacon—and Dan was bidden to an
interview at the “Scroopery.” After some hesitation
he visited it.</p>

<p>“Ah, Pavey,” said the rector, not at all minatory
but very subdued and unhappy. “So the blow has
fallen, in spite of my warning. I am more sorry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
than I can express, for it means an end to a very long
connection. It is very difficult and very disagreeable
for me to deal with the situation, but there is no help
for it now, you must understand that. I offer no
judgment upon these unfortunate events, no judgment
at all, but I can find no way of avoiding my
clear duty. Your course of life is incompatible with
your position in the choir, and I sadly fear it reveals
not only a social misdemeanour but a religious one—it
is a mockery, a mockery of God.”</p>

<p>The rector sat at a table with his head pressed on
his hands. Pavey sat opposite him, and in his hands
he dangled his bowler hat.</p>

<p>“You may be right enough in your way, sir, but
I’ve never mocked God. For the betting, I grant you.
It may be a dirty job, but I never ate the dirt myself,
I never betted in my life. It’s a way of life, a poor
man has but little chance of earning more than a bare
living, and there’s many a dirty job there’s no prosecution
for, leastways not in this world.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span></p>
<p>“Let me say, Pavey, that the betting counts less
heavily with me than the question of this unfortunate
little boy. I offer no judgment upon the matter,
your acknowledgment of him is only right and proper.
But the fact of his existence at all cannot be disregarded;
that at least is flagrant, and as far as concerns
your position in my church, it is a mockery of
God.”</p>

<p>“You may be right, sir, as far as your judgment
goes, or you may not be. I beg your pardon for that,
but we can only measure other people by our own
scales, and as we can never understand one another
entirely, so we can’t ever judge them rightly, for they
all differ from us and from each other in some special
ways. But as for being a mocker of God, why it
looks to me as if you was trying to teach the Almighty
how to judge me.”</p>

<p>“Pavey,” said the rector with solemnity, “I pity
you from the bottom of my heart. We won’t continue
this painful discussion, we should both regret
it. There was a man in the parish where I came from
who was an atheist and mocked God. He subsequently
became deaf. Was he convinced? No, he
was not—because the punishment came a long time
after his offence. He mocked God again, and
became blind. Not at once: God has eternity to
work in. Still he was not convinced. That,” said
the rector ponderously, “is what the Church has to
contend with; a failure to read the most obvious
signs, and an indisposition even to remedy that failure.
Klopstock was that poor man’s name. His sister—you
know her well, Jane Klopstock—is now my cook.”</p>

<p>The rector then stood up and held out his hand.
“God bless you, Pavey.”</p>

<p>“I thank you, sir,” said Dan. “I quite understand.”</p>

<p>He went home moodily reflecting. Nobody else
in the village minded his misdeeds, they did not care
a button, and none condemned him. On the contrary,
indeed. But the blow had fallen, there was
nothing that he could now do, the shock of it had
been anticipated, but it was severe. And the pang
would last, for he was deprived of his chief opportunity
for singing, that art in which he excelled, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
that perfect quiet setting he so loved. Rancour grew
upon him, and on Saturday he had a roaring audacious
evening at “The White Hart” where, to the tune of
“The British Grenadiers,” he sung a doggerel:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">Our parson loves his motor car</div>
   <div class="verse indent2">His garden and his mansion,</div>
   <div class="verse">And he loves his beef for I’ve remarked</div>
   <div class="verse indent2">His belly’s brave expansion;</div>
   <div class="verse">He loves all mortal mundane things</div>
   <div class="verse indent2">As he loved his beer at college,</div>

   <div class="verse">And he lies with a public sinner when</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>All of which was a savage libel on a very worthy man,
composed in anger and regretted as soon as sung.</p>

<p>From that time forward Dan gave up his boozing
and devoted himself to the boy, little Martin, who, a
Thasper joker suggested, might have some kinship
with the notorious Betty of that name. But Dan’s
voice was now seldom heard singing upon the roads
he travelled. They were icy wintry roads, but that
was not the cause of his muteness. It was severance
from the choir; not from its connoted spirit of
religion—there was little enough of that in Dan
Pavey—but from the solemn beauty of the chorale,
which it was his unique gift to adorn, and in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
he had shared with eagerness and pride since his
boyhood. To be cast out from that was to be cast
from something he held most dear, the opportunity
of expression in an art which he had made triumphantly
his own.</p>

<p>With the coming of spring he repaired one evening
to a town some miles away and interviewed a choirmaster.
Thereafter Dan Pavey journeyed to and fro
twice every Sunday to sing in a church that lay seven
or eight miles off, and he kept it all a profound secret
from Thasper until his appearance at the county
musical festival, where he won the treasured prize for
tenor soloists. Then Dan was himself again. To his
crude apprehension he had been vindicated, and he
was heard once more carolling in the lanes of the
Vale as he had been heard any time for these twenty
years.</p>

<p>The child began its schooling, but though he was
free to go about the village little Martin did not
wander far. The tidy cluster of hair about his poll
was of deep chestnut colour. His skin—Meg said—was
like “ollobarster”: it was soft and unfreckled,
always pale. His eyes were two wet damsons—so
Meg declared: they were dark and ever questioning.
As for his nose, his lips, his cheeks, his chin, Meg
could do no other than call it the face of a blessed
saint; and indeed, he had some of the bearing of a
saint, so quiet, so gentle, so shy. The golden ring
he no longer wore; it hung from a tintack on the
bedroom wall.</p>

<p>Old John, who lived next door, became a friend
of his. He was very aged—in the Vale you got to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
be a hundred before you knew where you were—and
he was very bent; he resembled a sickle standing
upon its handle. Very bald, too, and so very sharp.</p>

<p>Martin was staring up at the roof of John’s cottage.</p>

<p>“What you looking at, my boy?”</p>

<p>“Chimbley,” whispered the child.</p>

<p>“O ah! that’s crooked, a’nt it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, crooked.”</p>

<p>“I know ’tis, but I can’t help it; my chimney’s
crooked, and I can’t putt it straight, neither, I can’t
putt it right. My chimney’s crooked, a’nt it, ah,
and I’m crooked, too.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Martin.</p>

<p>“I know, but I can’t help it. It <i>is</i> crooked, a’nt
it?” said the old man, also staring up at a red pot
tilted at an angle suggestive of conviviality.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“That chimney’s crooked. But you come along
and look at my beautiful bird.”</p>

<p>A cock thrush inhabited a cage in the old gaffer’s
kitchen. Martin stood before it.</p>

<p>“There’s a beautiful bird. Hoicks!” cried old
John, tapping the bars of the cage with his terrible
finger-nail. “But he won’t sing.”</p>

<p>“Won’t he sing?”</p>

<p>“He donn make hisself at home. He donn make
hisself at home at all, do ’ee, my beautiful bird?
No, he donn’t. So I’m a-going to chop his head off,”
said the laughing old man, “and then I shall bile
him.”</p>

<p>Afterwards Martin went every day to see if the
thrush was still there. And it was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span></p>

<p>Martin grew. Almost before Dan was aware of it
the child had grown into a boy. At school he excelled
nobody in anything except, perhaps, behaviour,
but he had a strange little gift for unobtrusively not
doing the things he did not care for, and these were
rather many unless his father was concerned in them.
Even so, the affection between them was seldom
tangibly expressed, their alliance was something far
deeper than its expression. Dan talked with him as
if he were a grown man, and perhaps he often regarded
him as one; he was the only being to whom he ever
opened his mind. As they sat together in the evening
while Dan put in a spell at turning chair—at which
he was astoundingly adept—the father would talk
to his son, or rather he would heap upon him all the
unuttered thoughts that had accumulated in his
mind during his adult years. The dog would loll
with its head on Martin’s knees; the boy would sit
nodding gravely, though seldom speaking: he was
an untiring listener. “Like sire, like son,” thought
Dan, “he will always coop his thoughts up within
himself.” It was the one characteristic of the boy
that caused him anxiety.</p>

<p>“Never take pattern by me,” he would adjure him,
“not by me. I’m a fool, a failure, just grass, and I’m
trying to instruct you, but you’ve no call to follow in
my fashion; I’m a weak man. There’s been thoughts
in my mind that I daren’t let out. I wanted to do
things that other men don’t seem to do and don’t
want to do. They were not evil things—and what
they were I’ve nigh forgotten now. I never had
much ambition, I wasn’t clever, I wanted to live a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
simple life, in a simple way, the way I had a mind to—I
can’t remember that either. But I did not do any
of those things because I had a fear of what other
people might think of me. I walked in the ruck with
the rest of my mates and did the things I didn’t ever
want to do—and now I can only wonder why I did
them. I sung them the silly songs they liked, and
not the ones I cherished. I agreed with most everybody,
and all agreed with me. I’m a friendly man,
too friendly, and I went back on my life, I made
nought of my life, you see, I just sat over the job like
a snob codgering an old boot.”</p>

<p>The boy would sit regarding him as if he already
understood. Perhaps that curious little mind did
glean some flavour of his father’s tragedy.</p>

<p>“You’ve no call to follow me, you’ll be a scholar.
Of course I know some of those long words at school
take a bit of licking together—like elephant and
saucepan. You get about half-way through ’em and
then you’re done, you’re mastered. I was just the
same (like sire, like son), and I’m no better now.
If you and me was to go to yon school together, and
set on the same stool together, I warrant you would
win the prize and I should wear the dunce’s cap—all
except sums, and there I should beat ye. You’d have
all the candy and I’d have all the cane, you’d be king
and I’d be the dirty rascal, so you’ve no call to follow
me. What you want is courage, and to do the things
you’ve a mind to. I never had any and I didn’t.”</p>

<p>Dan seldom kissed his son, neither of them sought
that tender expression, though Meg was for ever
ruffling the boy for these pledges of affection, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
was always gracious to the old woman. There was a
small mole in the centre of her chin, and in the centre
of the mole grew one short stiff hair. It was a
surprise to Martin when he first kissed her.</p>

<p>Twice a week father and son bathed in the shed
devoted to chair. The tub was the half of a wooden
barrel. Dan would roll up two or three buckets of
water from the well, they would both strip to the
skin, the boy would kneel in the tub and dash the
water about his body for a few moments. While
Martin towelled himself Dan stepped into the tub,
and after laving his face and hands and legs he would
sit down in it. “Ready?” Martin would ask, and
scooping up the water in an iron basin he would
pour it over his father’s head.</p>

<p>“Name O’ God, that’s sharpish this morning,”
Dan would say, “it would strip the bark off a crocodile.
Broo-o-o-oh! But there: winter and summer
I go up and down the land and there’s not—Broo-o-o-oh!—a
mighty difference between ’em, it’s mostly
fancy. Come day, go day, frost or fair doings, all
alike I go about the land, and there’s little in winter
I havn’t the heart to rejoice in. (On with your
breeches or I’ll be at the porridge pot afore you’re
clad.) All their talk about winter and their dread of
it shows poor spirit. Nothing’s prettier than a fall
of snow, nothing more grand than the storms
upending the woods. There’s no more rain in winter
than in summer, you can be shod for it, and there’s
a heart back of your ribs that’s proof against any
blast. (Is this my shirt or yours? Dashed if they
buttons a’nt the plague of my life.) Country is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
grand year’s end to year’s end, whether or no. I
once lived in London—only a few weeks—and for
noise, and for terror, and for filth—name O’ God,
there was bugs in the butter there, once there was!”</p>

<p>But the boy’s chosen season was that time of year
when the plums ripened. Pavey’s garden was then
a tiny paradise.</p>

<p>“You put a spell on these trees,” Dan would
declare to his son every year when they gathered the
fruit. “I planted them nearly twenty years ago, two
'gages and one magny bonum, but they never growed
enough to make a pudden. They always bloomed
well and looked well. I propped ’em and I dunged
'em, but they wouldn’t beer at all, and I’m a-going to
cut ’em down—when, along comes you!”</p>

<p>Well, hadn’t those trees borne remarkable ever
since he’d come there?</p>

<p>“Of course, good luck’s deceiving, and it’s never
bothered our family overmuch. Still, bad luck is one
thing and bad life’s another. And yet—I dunno—they
come to much the same in the end, there’s very
little difference. There’s so much misunderstanding,
half the folks don’t know their own good intentions,
nor all the love that’s sunk deep in their own
minds.”</p>

<p>But nothing in the world gave (or could give) Dan
such flattering joy as his son’s sweet treble voice.
Martin could sing! In the dark months no evening
passed without some instruction by the proud father.
The living room at the back of the shop was the
tiniest of rooms, and its smallness was not lessened,
nor its tidiness increased, by the stacks of merchandise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
that had strayed from Meg’s emporium into every
corner, and overflowed every shelf in packages,
piles, and bundles. The metalliferous categories—iron
nails, lead pencils, tintacks, zinc ointment, and
brass hinges—were there. Platoons of bottles were
there, bottles of blue-black writing fluid, bottles of
scarlet—and presumably plebeian—ink, bottles of
lollipops and of oil (both hair and castor). Balls of
string, of blue, of peppermint, and balls to bounce
were adjacent to an assortment of prim-looking
books—account memorandum, exercise, and note.
But the room was cosy, and if its inhabitants fitted it
almost as closely as birds fit their nests they were as
happy as birds, few of whom (save the swallows) sing
in their nests. With pitchpipe to hand and a bundle
of music before them Dan and Martin would begin.
The dog would snooze on the rug before the fire;
Meg would snooze amply in her armchair until
roused by the sudden terrific tinkling of her shop-bell.
She would waddle off to her dim little shop—every
step she took rattling the paraffin lamp on the
table, the coal in the scuttle, and sometimes the very
panes in the window—and the dog would clamber
into her chair. Having supplied an aged gaffer with
an ounce of carraway seed, or some gay lad with a
packet of cigarettes, Meg would waddle back and
sink down upon the dog, whereupon its awful
indignation would sound to the very heavens,
drowning the voices even of Dan and his son.</p>

<p>“What shall we wind up with?” Dan would ask
at the close of the lesson, and as often as not Martin
would say:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span> “You must sing ‘Timmie.’”</p>

<p>This was “Timmie,” and it had a tune something
like the chorus to “Father O’Flynn.”</p>

<p>On the third anniversary of Martin’s homecoming
Dan rose up very early in the dark morn, and leaving
his son sleeping he crept out of the house followed
by his dog. They went away from Thasper, though
the darkness was profound and the grass filled with
dew, out upon the hills towards Chapel Cheary. The
night was starless, but Dan knew every trick and turn
of the paths, and after an hour’s walk he met a man
waiting by a signpost. They conversed for a few
minutes and then went off together, the dog at their
heels, until they came to a field gate. Upon this
they fastened a net and then sent the dog into the
darkness upon his errand, while they waited for the
hare which the dog would drive into the net. They
waited so long that it was clear the dog had not
drawn its quarry. Dan whistled softly, but the dog
did not return. Dan opened the gate and went down
the fields himself, scouring the hedges for a long time,
but he could not find the dog. The murk of the
night had begun to lift, but the valley was filled with
mist. He went back to the gate: the net had been
taken down, his friend had departed—perhaps he
had been disturbed? The dog had now been missing
for an hour. Dan still hung about, but neither friend
nor dog came back. It grew grey and more grey,
though little could be distinguished, the raw mist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
obscuring everything that the dawn uncovered. He
shivered with gloom and dampness, his boots were
now as pliable as gloves, his eyebrows had grey
drops upon them, so had his moustache and the
backs of his hands. His dark coat looked as if it
was made of grey wool; it was tightly buttoned around
his throat and he stood with his chin crumpled, unconsciously
holding his breath until it burst forth in
a gasp. But he could not abandon his dog, and he
roamed once more down into the misty valley
towards woods that he knew well, whistling softly
and with great caution a repetition of two notes.</p>

<p>And he found his dog. It was lying on a heap of
dead sodden leaves. It just whimpered. It could not
rise, it could not move, it seemed paralysed. Dawn
was now really upon them. Dan wanted to get the
dog away, quickly, it was a dangerous quarter, but
when he lifted it to his feet the dog collapsed like a
scarecrow. In a flash Dan knew he was poisoned,
he had probably picked up some piece of dainty flesh
that a farmer had baited for the foxes. He seized a
knob of chalk that lay thereby, grated some of it into
his hands, and forced it down the dog’s throat. Then
he tied the lead to its neck. He was going to drag
the dog to its feet and force it to walk. But the dog
was past all energy, it was limp and mute. Dan
dragged him by the neck for some yards as a man
draws behind him a heavy sack. It must have
weighed three stone, but Dan lifted him on to his
own shoulders and staggered back up the hill. He
carried it thus for half a mile, but then he was still
four miles from home, and it was daylight, at any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
moment he might meet somebody he would not care
to meet. He entered a ride opening into some coverts,
and, bending down, slipped the dog over his head to
rest upon the ground. He was exhausted and felt
giddy, his brains were swirling round—trying to slop
out of his skull—and—yes—the dog was dead, his
old dog dead. When he looked up, he saw a keeper
with a gun standing a few yards off.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” said Dan. All his weariness
was suddenly gone from him.</p>

<p>“I’ll have your name and address,” replied the
keeper, a giant of a man, with a sort of contemptuous
affability.</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“You’ll hear about what for,” the giant grinned.
“I’ll be sure to let ye know, in doo coorse.” He laid
his gun upon the ground and began searching in his
pockets, while Dan stood up with rage in his heart
and confusion in his mind. So the Old Imp was at
him again!</p>

<p>“Humph!” said the keeper. “I’ve alost my
notebook somewheres. Have you got a bit of paper
on ye?”</p>

<p>The culprit searched his pockets and produced a
folded fragment.</p>

<p>“Thanks.” The giant did not cease to grin.
“What is it?”</p>

<p>“What?” queried Dan.</p>

<p>“Your name and address.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but what do you want it for. What do you
think I’m doing?” protested Dan.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span></p>
<p>“I’ve a net in my pocket which I took from a gate
about an hour ago. I saw summat was afoot, and
me and a friend o’ mine have been looking for ’ee.
Now let’s have your name and no nonsense.”</p>

<p>“My name,” said Dan, “my name? Well, it is
... Piper.”</p>

<p>“Piper is it, ah! Was you baptized ever?”</p>

<p>“Peter,” said Dan savagely.</p>

<p>“Peter Piper! Well, you’ve picked a tidy pepper-carn
this time.”</p>

<p>Again he was searching his pockets. There was
a frown on his face. “You’d better lend me a bit o’
pencil too.”</p>

<p>Dan produced a stump of lead pencil and the
gamekeeper, smoothing the paper on his lifted knee,
wrote down the name of Peter Piper.</p>

<p>“And where might you come from?” He peered
up at the miserable man, who replied: “From
Leasington”—naming a village several miles to the
west of his real home.</p>

<p>“Leasington!” commented the other. “You
must know John Eustace, then?” John Eustace
was a sporting farmer famed for his stock and his
riches.</p>

<p>“Know him!” exclaimed Dan. “He’s my uncle!”</p>

<p>“O ah!” The other carefully folded the paper
and put it into his breast pocket. “Well, you can
trot along home now, my lad.”</p>

<p>Dan knelt down and unbuckled the collar from his
dead dog’s neck. He was fond of his dog, it looked
piteous now. And kneeling there it suddenly came
upon Dan that he had been a coward again, he had
told nothing but lies, foolish lies, and he had let a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
great hulking flunkey walk roughshod over him.
In one astonishing moment the reproving face of his
little son seemed to loom up beside the dog, the blood
flamed in his brain.</p>

<p>“I’ll take charge of that,” said the keeper, snatching
the collar from his hand.</p>

<p>“Blast you!” Dan sprang to his feet, and suddenly
screaming like a madman: “I’m Dan Pavey
of Thasper,” he leapt at the keeper with a fury that
shook even that calm stalwart.</p>

<p>“You would, would ye?” he yapped, darting for
his gun. Dan also seized it, and in their struggle the
gun was fired off harmlessly between them. Dan
let go.</p>

<p>“My God!” roared the keeper, “you’d murder
me, would ye? Wi’ my own gun, would ye?” He
struck Dan a swinging blow with the butt of it,
yelling: “Would ye? Would ye? Would ye?”
And he did not cease striking until Dan tumbled
senseless and bloody across the body of the dog.</p>

<p>Soon another keeper came hurrying through the
trees.</p>

<p>“Tried to murder me—wi’ me own gun, he did,”
declared the big man, “wi’ me own gun!”</p>

<p>They revived the stricken Pavey after a while and
then conveyed him to a policeman, who conveyed him
to a gaol.</p>

<p>The magistrates took a grave view of the case and
sent it for trial at the assizes. They were soon held,
he had not long to wait, and before the end of November
he was condemned. The assize court was a
place of intolerable gloom, intolerable formality,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
intolerable pain, but the public seemed to enjoy it.
The keeper swore Dan had tried to shoot him, and
the prisoner contested this. He did not deny that
he was the aggressor. The jury found him guilty.
What had he to say? He had nothing to say, but he
was deeply moved by the spectacle of the Rev.
Scroope standing up and testifying to his sobriety,
his honesty, his general good repute, and pleading for
a lenient sentence because he was a man of considerable
force of character, misguided no doubt, a little
unfortunate, and prone to recklessness.</p>

<p>Said the judge, examining the papers of the indictment:
“I see there is a previous conviction—for
betting offences.”</p>

<p>“That was three years ago, my lord. There has
been nothing of the kind since, my lord, of that I am
sure, quite sure.”</p>

<p>Scroope showed none of his old time confident
aspect, he was perspiring and trembling. The clerk
of the assize leaned up and held a whispered colloquy
with the judge, who then addressed the rector.</p>

<p>“Apparently he is still a betting agent. He gave a
false name and address, which was taken down by the
keeper on a piece of paper furnished by the prisoner.
Here it is, on one side the name of Peter Pope (Piper,
sir!) Piper: and on the other side this is written:</p>

<p>
<i>3 o/c race. Pretty Dear, 5/- to win. J. Klopstock.</i><br />
</p>

<p>Are there any Klopstocks in your parish?”</p>

<p>“Klopstock!” murmured the parson, “it is the
name of my cook.”</p>

<p>What had the prisoner to say about that? The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
prisoner had nothing to say, and he was sentenced to
twelve months’ imprisonment with hard labour.</p>

<p>So Dan was taken away. He was a tough man, an
amenable man, and the mere rigours of the prison did
not unduly afflict him. His behaviour was good, and
he looked forward to gaining the maximum remission
of his sentence. Meg, his mother, went to see him
once, alone, but she did not repeat the visit. The prison
chaplain paid him special attention. He, too, was a
Scroope, a huge fellow, not long from Oxford, and
Pavey learned that he was related to the Thasper
rector. The new year came, February came, March
came, and Dan was afforded some privileges. His
singing in chapel was much admired, and occasionally
he was allowed to sing to the prisoners. April
came, May came, and then his son Martin was
drowned in a boating accident, on a lake, in a park.
The Thasper children had been taken there for a
holiday. On hearing it, Pavey sank limply to the
floor of his cell. The warders sat him up, but they
could make nothing of him, he was dazed, and he
could not speak. He was taken to the hospital wing.
“This man has had a stroke, he is gone dumb,” said
the doctor. On the following day he appeared to be
well enough, but still he could not speak. He went
about the ward doing hospital duty, dumb as a
ladder; he could not even mourn, but a jig kept
flickering through his voiceless mind:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">In a park there was a lake,</div>
   <div class="verse">On the lake there was a boat,</div>
   <div class="verse">In the boat there was a boy.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Hour after hour the stupid jingle flowed through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
his consciousness. Perhaps it kept him from going
mad, but it did not bring him back his speech, he was
dumb, dumb. And he remembered a man who had
been stricken deaf, and then blind—Scroope knew
him too, it was some man who had mocked God.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">In a park there was a lake,</div>
   <div class="verse">On the lake there was a boat,</div>
   <div class="verse">In the boat there was a boy.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>On the day of the funeral Pavey imagined that he
had been let out of prison; he dreamed that someone
had been kind and set him free for an hour or two
to bury his dead boy. He seemed to arrive at Thasper
when the ceremony was already begun, the
coffin was already in the church. Pavey knelt down
beside his mother. The rector intoned the office, the
child was taken to its grave. Dumb dreaming
Pavey turned his eyes from it. The day was too
bright for death, it was a stainless day. The wind
seemed to flow in soft streams, rolling the lilac
blooms. A small white feather, blown from a pigeon
on the church gable, whirled about like a butterfly.
“We give thee hearty thanks,” the priest was saying,
“for that it hath pleased thee to deliver this our
brother out of the miseries of this sinful world.” At
the end of it all Pavey kissed his mother, and saw
himself turn back to his prison. He went by the field
paths away to the railway junction. The country had
begun to look a little parched, for rain was wanted—vividly
he could see all this—but things were growing,
corn was thriving greenly, the beanfields smelled
sweet. A frill of yellow kilk and wild white carrot
spray lined every hedge. Cattle dreamed in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
grass, the colt stretched itself unregarded in front of
its mother. Larks, wrens, yellow-hammers. There
were the great beech trees and the great hills, calm
and confident, overlooking Cobbs and Peter, Thasper
and Trinkel, Buzzlebury and Nuncton. He sees
the summer is coming on, he is going back to prison.
“Courage is vain,” he thinks, “we are like the grass
underfoot, a blade that excels is quickly shorn. In
this sort of a world the poor have no call to be proud,
they had only need be penitent.”</p>

<h2 id="Luxury"><i>Luxury</i></h2>


<p>Eight o’clock of a fine spring
morning in the hamlet of Kezzal Predy Peter,
great horses with chains clinking down the
road, and Alexander Finkle rising from his bed singing:
“O lah soh doh, soh lah me doh,” timing his
notes to the ching of his neighbour’s anvil. He boils
a cupful of water on an oil stove, his shaving brush
stands (where it always stands) upon the window-ledge
(“Soh lah soh do-o-o-oh, soh doh soh
la-a-a-ah!”) but as he addresses himself to his toilet
the clamour of the anvil ceases and then Finkle too
becomes silent, for the unresting cares of his life
begin again to afflict him.</p>

<p>“This cottage is no good,” he mumbles, “and
I’m no good. Literature is no good when you live
too much on porridge. Your writing’s no good, sir,
you can’t get any glow out of oatmeal. Why did you
ever come here? It’s a hopeless job and you know
it!” Stropping his razor petulantly as if the soul of
that frustrating oatmeal lay there between the leather
and the blade, he continues: “But it isn’t the cottage,
it isn’t me, it isn’t the writing—it’s the privation.
I must give it up and get a job as a railway porter.”</p>

<p>And indeed he was very impoverished, the living
he derived from his writings was meagre; the cottage
had many imperfections, both its rooms were gloomy,
and to obviate the inconvenience arising from its
defective roof he always slept downstairs.</p>

<p>Two years ago he had been working for a wall-paper
manufacturer in Bethnal Green. He was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
poor then, not so very poor, he had the clothes he
stood up in (they were good clothes) and fifty pounds
in the bank besides. But although he had served the
wall-paper man for fifteen years that fifty pounds had
not been derived from clerking, he had earned it by
means of his hobby, a little knack of writing things
for provincial newspapers. On his thirty-first birthday
Finkle argued—for he had a habit of conducting
long and not unsatisfactory discussions between
himself and a self that apparently wasn’t him—that
what he could do reasonably well in his scanty leisure
could be multiplied exceedingly if he had time and
opportunity, lived in the country, somewhere where
he could go into a garden to smell the roses or whatever
was blooming and draw deep draughts of happiness,
think his profound thoughts and realize the
goodness of God, and then sit and read right through
some long and difficult book about Napoleon or
Mahomet. Bursting with literary ambition Finkle
had hesitated no longer: he could live on nothing
in the country—for a time. He had the fifty pounds,
he had saved it, it had taken him seven years, but he
had made it and saved it. He handed in his notice.
That was very astonishing to his master, who esteemed
him, but more astonishing to Finkle was the parting
gift of ten pounds which the master had given him.
The workmen, too, had collected more money for him,
and bought for him a clock, a monster, it weighed
twelve pounds and had a brass figure of Lohengrin
on the top, while the serene old messenger man who
cleaned the windows and bought surreptitious beer
for the clerks gave him a prescription for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
instantaneous relief of a painful stomach ailment. “It
might come in handy,” he had said. That was two
years ago, and now just think! He had bought
himself an inkpot of crystalline glass—a large one,
it held nearly half a pint—and two pens, one for red
ink and one for black, besides a quill for signing his
name with. Here he was at “Pretty Peter” and the
devil himself was in it! Nothing had ever been right,
the hamlet itself was poor. Like all places near the
chalk hills its roads were of flint, the church was of
flint, the farms and cots of flint with brick corners.
There was an old milestone outside his cot, he was
pleased with that, it gave the miles to London and the
miles to Winchester, it was nice to have a milestone
there like that—your very own.</p>

<p>He finished shaving and threw open the cottage
door; the scent of wallflowers and lilac came to him
as sweet almost as a wedge of newly cut cake. The
may bloom on his hedge drooped over the branches
like crudded cream, and the dew in the gritty road
smelled of harsh dust in a way that was pleasant.
Well, if the cottage wasn’t much good, the bit of a
garden was all right.</p>

<p>There was a rosebush too, a little vagrant in its
growth. He leaned over his garden gate; there was
no one in sight. He took out the fire shovel and
scooped up a clot of manure that lay in the road
adjacent to his cottage and trotted back to place it in a
little heap at the root of those scatter-brained roses,
pink and bulging, that never seemed to do very well
and yet were so satisfactory.</p>

<p>“Nicish day,” remarked Finkle, lolling against his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
doorpost, “but it’s always nice if you are doing a
good day’s work. The garden is all right, and literature
is all right, and life’s all right—only I live too
much on porridge. It isn’t the privation itself, it’s
the things privation makes a man do. It makes a
man do things he ought not want to do, it makes him
mean, it makes him feel mean, I tell you, and if he
feels mean and thinks mean he writes meanly, that’s
how it is.”</p>

<p>He had written topical notes and articles, stories of
gay life (of which he knew nothing), of sport (of
which he knew less), a poem about “hope,” and
some cheerful pieces for a girls’ weekly paper. And
yet his outgoings still exceeded his income, painfully
and perversely after two years. It was terrifying.
He wanted success, he had come to conquer—not to
find what he <i>had</i> found. But he would be content
with encouragement now even if he did not win
success; it was absolutely necessary, he had not sold
a thing for six months, his public would forget him,
his connection would be gone.</p>

<p>“There’s no use though,” mused Finkle, as he
scrutinized his worn boots, “in looking at things in
detail, that’s mean; a large view is the thing. Whatever
is isolated is bound to look alarming.”</p>

<p>But he continued to lean against the doorpost in the
full blaze of the stark, almost gritty sunlight, thinking
mournfully until he heard the porridge in the saucepan
begin to bubble. Turning into the room he felt
giddy, and scarlet spots and other phantasmagoria
waved in the air before him.</p>

<p>Without an appetite he swallowed the porridge and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
ate some bread and cheese and watercress. Watercress,
at least, was plentiful there, for the little runnels
that came down from the big hills expanded in the
Predy Peter fields and in their shallow bottoms the
cress flourished.</p>

<p>He finished his breakfast, cleared the things away,
and sat down to see if he could write, but it was in
vain—he could not write. He could think, but his
mind would embrace no subject, it just teetered about
with the objects within sight, the empty, disconsolate
grate, the pattern of the rug, and the black butterfly
that had hung dead upon the wall for so many months.
Then he thought of the books he intended to read
but could never procure, the books he had procured
but did not like, the books he had liked but was
already, so soon, forgetting. Smoking would have
helped and he wanted to smoke, but he could not
afford it now. If ever he had a real good windfall he
intended to buy a tub, a little tub it would have to be
of course, and he would fill it to the bung with
cigarettes, full to the bung, if it cost him pounds.
And he would help himself to one whenever he had
a mind to do so.</p>

<p>“Bah, you fool!” he murmured, “you think you
have the whole world against you, that you are
fighting it, keeping up your end with heroism! Idiot!
What does it all amount to? You’ve withdrawn
yourself from the world, run away from it, and here
you sit making futile dabs at it, like a child sticking
pins into a pudding and wondering why nothing
happens. What <i>could</i> happen? What? The world
doesn’t know about you, or care, you are useless.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
It isn’t aware of you any more than a chain of mountains
is aware of a gnat. And whose fault is that—is it
the mountains’ fault? Idiot! But I can’t starve and
I must go and get a job as a railway porter, it’s all
I’m fit for.”</p>

<p>Two farmers paused outside Finkle’s garden and
began a solid conversation upon a topic that made him
feel hungry indeed. He listened, fascinated, though
he was scarcely aware of it.</p>

<p>“Six-stone lambs,” said one, “are fetching three
pounds apiece.”</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>“I shall fat some.”</p>

<p>“Myself I don’t care for lamb, never did care.”</p>

<p>“It’s good eating.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but I don’t care for it. Now we had a bit
of spare rib last night off an old pig. ’Twas cold,
you know, but beautiful. I said to my dame: ‘What
can mortal man want better than spare rib off an old
pig? Tender and white, ate like lard.’”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s good eating.”</p>

<p>“Nor veal, I don’t like—nothing that’s young.”</p>

<p>“Veal’s good eating.”</p>

<p>“Don’t care for it, never did, it eats short to my
mind.”</p>

<p>Then the school bell began to ring so loudly that
Finkle could hear no more, but his mind continued
to hover over the choice of lamb or veal or old pork
until he was angry. Why had he done this foolish
thing, thrown away his comfortable job, reasonable
food, ease of mind, friendship, pocket money,
tobacco? Even his girl had forgotten him. Why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
had he done this impudent thing, it was insanity
surely? But he knew that man has instinctive
reasons that transcend logic, what a parson would call
the superior reason of the heart.</p>

<p>“I wanted a change, and I got it. Now I want
another change, but what shall I get? Chance and
change, they are the sweet features of existence.
Chance and change, and not too much prosperity. If I
were an idealist I could live from my hair upwards.”</p>

<p>The two farmers separated. Finkle staring haplessly
from his window saw them go. Some schoolboys
were playing a game of marbles in the road
there. Another boy sat on the green bank quietly
singing, while one in spectacles knelt slyly behind
him trying to burn a hole in the singer’s breeches with
a magnifying glass. Finkle’s thoughts still hovered
over the flavours and satisfactions of veal and lamb
and pig until, like mother Hubbard, he turned and
opened his larder.</p>

<p>There, to his surprise, he saw four bananas lying
on a saucer. Bought from a travelling hawker a
couple of days ago they had cost him threepence
halfpenny. And he had forgotten them! He could
not afford another luxury like that for a week at least,
and he stood looking at them, full of doubt. He
debated whether he should take one now, he would
still have one left for Wednesday, one for Thursday,
and one for Friday. But he thought he would not,
he had had his breakfast and he had not remembered
them. He grew suddenly and absurdly angry again.
That was the worst of poverty, not what it made you
endure, but what it made you <i>want</i> to endure. Why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
shouldn’t he eat a banana—why shouldn’t he eat all
of them? And yet bananas always seemed to him
such luxuriant, expensive things, so much peel, and
then two, or not more than three, delicious bites.
But if he fancied a banana—there it was. No, he did
not want to destroy the blasted thing! No reason at
all why he should not, but that was what continuous
hardship did for you, nothing could stop this miserable
feeling for economy now. If he had a thousand
pounds at this moment he knew he would be careful
about bananas and about butter and about sugar and
things like that; but he would never have a thousand
pounds, nobody had ever had it, it was impossible to
believe that anyone had ever had wholly and entirely
to themselves a thousand pounds. It could not be
believed. He was like a man dreaming that he had
the hangman’s noose around his neck; yet the drop
did not take place, it did not take place, and it would
not take place. But the noose was still there. He
picked up the bananas one by one, the four bananas,
the whole four. No other man in the world, surely,
had ever had four such fine bananas as that and not
wanted to eat them? O, why had such stupid, mean
scruples seized him again? It was disgusting and
ungenerous to himself, it made him feel mean, it <i>was</i>
mean! Rushing to his cottage door he cried: “Here
y’are!” to the playing schoolboys and flung two of
the bananas into the midst of them. Then he flung
another. He hesitated at the fourth, and tearing the
peel from it he crammed the fruit into his own mouth,
wolfing it down and gasping:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span> “So perish all such
traitors.”</p>

<p>When he had completely absorbed its savour, he
stared like a fool at the empty saucer. It was empty,
the bananas were gone, all four irrecoverably gone.</p>

<p>“Damned pig!” cried Finkle.</p>

<p>But then he sat down and wrote all this, just as it
appears.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
